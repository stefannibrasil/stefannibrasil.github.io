		<div class="post-content"><p>Hello, I’m stefanni.</p>

<p>I’m originally from brazil but i’ve been living in Vancouver, BC since 2018.</p>

<p>I’m a software developer working at Lendesk, and currently bootstrapping a side-project called hexdevs with my partner Thiago Araujo. If you are a developer and are interested in working remotely (or how to work remotely more efficiently), finding a job abroad, starting a side business or just getting better as a professional, check us out and let us know what do you think.</p>

<p>This blog is a place where I can share more about what I’m reading and doing. Some of my current interests are investments, cognitive biases, financial independence, bootstrapping a business, zero waste movement, trying to eat less meat in general, personal growth and cats.</p>

<p>I feel like I’ve changed a lot (is that what maturity feels like? lol) and I don’t want to focus just on software anymore: I love learning about it and building software but I want to give space for my other interests as well. And what I’ve learned from my experience working with software is that, the more I develop my soft skills, the better I get as a software developer.</p>

<p>Hope that gave you a better sense about me. Feel free to reach out at stefanni at hexdevs dot com.</p>
