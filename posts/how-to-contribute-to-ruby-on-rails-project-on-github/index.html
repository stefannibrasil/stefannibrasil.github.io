Even worse: they all seem pretty hard.\nIf this daunting feeling is familiar to you, welcome to the club my friend because I know how does that feel like. By the end of this post, youâ€™ll feel less intimated to contribute to rails today (if you want).\nOpen source onboarding for the rest of us Eileen Uchitelle, from the Rails Core Team Member, mentioned on her railsconf keynote how she got started. She did lots of pair programming with experienced rails contributors.\nBut, you probably donâ€™t work for Shopify or Github. At least, I donâ€™t.\nThat got me thinkingâ€¦ what if I donâ€™t have to do it by myself?\nSo I recruited Thiago, my partner in crime to do it with me. We tried to make good use of the hexdevs YouTube channel to share our contribution to rails live.\nTo our surprise, Gabi Stefanini, Engineering Team Lead at Shopify, and Rafael Franca (Rails core contributor, also from Shopify) joined us!\nWe didnâ€™t expect anyone to show up to be honest, but having them there made us feel less intimated. We also learned a lot doing this chat remote onboarding with them:\n Not sure how to know if you set up rails successfully? Running the test suites means youâ€™re good to go ðŸŽ‰ You donâ€™t actually need to set up the entire rails project to get started. You can choose one module. We went with ActionPack because it doesnâ€™t require any database drivers. After forking and cloning the project, go to the module you want to get started and run the tests to verify the setup (cd activepack then rake tests). Hint: we had to run the tests as bundle exec rake test! Contributing to Open Source goes beyond writing code. Reproducing issues or testing patches, translating the guides are all great ways to get started and make a difference with your work. If you found something confusing or missing, why not turn it into a better experience for the next person? Chances are youâ€™re not the only one. Keeping the documentation up to date and clear to whoever joins after you is super important to make other beginners get involved. Open source etiquette is learned byâ€¦ making contributions. A great way to get started is to look at previous commits and Pull requests. I wasnâ€™t sure how to name my branch, my commits, or even my Pull Request but Thiago suggested looking at the previous ones to get an idea. I was super nervous but having someone there was very comforting! The rails documentation is great! Kudos to whoever put effort and time into creating it! Nothing beats the developer experience of having great documentation. Having your first PR merged live was a hell of a surprise!  Your Homework: contribute to rails today Go to the rails project on github. Fork it, then clone it. Take a look at the modules there and choose one to get started by making sure you can run its test suite.\nGo through the documentation and see if you can find something that needs to be updated, or translated. Could you try reproducing a bug? Fixing a patch?\nLet me know what you end up doing! Start small but start today. Youâ€™ll never know how much youâ€™ll learn from this experience ðŸ™‚\nIf you found this post useful and want to get involved with contributing to rails with us, youâ€™re super invited to join us next time! We want to install rails the easy way using a VM (I found this super cool! You donâ€™t need to install all the dependencies by yourself) and be able to run all the tests.\nThe easiest way to get notified is to sign up for my mailing list below, or to subscribe to our YouTube channel to set reminders for next time we go live.\n Join other Rails developers just like you and sign up for my newsletter for more stuff like what you just read:   ","wordCount":"795","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://www.stefannibrasil.me/images/posts/contributing-to-rails-beginners_pr.png","datePublished":"2021-04-28T15:43:57-07:00","dateModified":"2021-05-08T12:54:12-07:00","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Stefanni Brasil"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.stefannibrasil.me/posts/how-to-contribute-to-ruby-on-rails-project-on-github/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"ðŸŒŸ Stefanni Brasil","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://www.stefannibrasil.me/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>if(localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"){document.body.classList.add('dark');}else if(localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"){document.body.classList.remove('dark')}else if(window.matchMedia('(prefers-color-scheme: dark)').matches){document.body.classList.add('dark');}</script><noscript><style type=text/css>.theme-toggle,.top-link{display:none}</style></noscript><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://www.stefannibrasil.me/ accesskey=h title="ðŸŒŸ Stefanni Brasil (Alt + H)">ðŸŒŸ Stefanni Brasil</a>
