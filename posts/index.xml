      <description>Before you get too excited and run rails new thecoolest --api on your terminal, you need to take some time to consider what your needs are.
How to choose which Rails alternative to implement your API? To help you decide which Rails alternative you should use, here is a comparison of the most common API scenarios:
   Requirements Rails API-only Full Rails stack     Login/logout (sessions) N Y   Cookies N Y   Social logins (FB, Google) N Y   Render HTML (web interfaces) N Y   HTTP Header Authentication Y Y   JSON Y Y    If your client will be a SPA (single-page application) or a native mobile app, and that&amp;rsquo;s where all the user interaction is going to live, then Rails API-only is a good choice.</description>

      <description>Which authentication strategy should you use for Rails API? How to implement a secure authentication strategy is by the far the most confusing part of building an API.
It&amp;rsquo;s important to evaluate your app requirements before choosing any strategy in the first place to avoid any security implications.
To help you figure out which authentication strategy is the best for your case, here are 5 possible solutions for you:
Rails API-only If your API is running as a standalone app and you don&amp;rsquo;t need a web interface of any sort, then a header-based token auth might be enough.</description>

      <title>Balancing present and future with the FIRE movement</title>

      <description>The first time I realized I was being too future-focused was when I got in a bad mental health state in 2020.
I didn’t want to pay for Cognitive-Behavior Therapy sessions. I could have, but I didn’t want to spend money on it. Not super clever, I know.
Looking back, I get mad at myself for putting savings before my mental health needs. This experience changed me, since it took me less than one year to improve my mental health, live a happier and confident life.</description>

When I was learning how to code in 2016, Ruby on Rails was trending and every startup was using it. It was obvious that learning Rails would be an easy way to get my first dev job. We&amp;rsquo;re in 2021, though, and things have changed.
The answer to &amp;ldquo;Is Rails still relevant?</description>
