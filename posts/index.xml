      <description>Ruby on Rails API-only gives you all the API standard functionalities (JSON, HTTP headers, Parameter parsing, and Token Authentication, etc.) following the well-known Rails standards.
Before you get too excited and run rails new thecoolest --api on your terminal, you need to take some time to consider what your needs are. You might run into the most confusing part of an API-only Rails app: implementing a secure authentication strategy.
That&amp;rsquo;s because a Rails API-only requests are stateless, so it won&amp;rsquo;t include any functionalities primarily used by browser clients, such as sessions and cookies.</description>

      <title>5 Ways to Handle Your Rails API Authentication</title>

      <description>Which authentication strategy should you use for Rails API? How to implement a secure authentication strategy is by the far the most confusing part of building an API.
It&amp;rsquo;s extremely important to evaluate your app requirements before choosing any strategy in the first place to avoid any security implications.
There&amp;rsquo;s nothing worse than having to turn your entire Rails API-only into a regular Rails app because midway you realized you needed an OAuth authentication code flow or have an interface for your users, right?</description>

      <description>The first time I realized I was being too future-focused was when I got in a bad mental health state in 2020.
I didn’t want to pay for Cognitive-Behavior Therapy sessions. I could have, but I didn’t want to spend money on it.
Looking back, I get mad at myself for putting savings before my mental health needs. This experience changed me, since it took me less than one year to improve my mental health, live a happier and confident life.</description>

When I was learning how to code in 2016, Ruby on Rails was trending and every startup was using it. It was obvious that learning Rails would be an easy way to get my first dev job.
But that was more than 4 years ago.</description>
