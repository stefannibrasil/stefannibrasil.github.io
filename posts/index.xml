      <description>As someone who used to be super focused on setting and achieving goals, at the expense of impacting my mental health and well-being, learning how to be more present and resilient has become my priority.
I&amp;rsquo;m done being a slave driver and beating myself up when things don&amp;rsquo;t work out as I want (or as I want and fear of success kicks in).
That&amp;rsquo;s why I loved this series about achievement orientation from the First Person Plural podcast.</description>

      <title>The 3 Things That Improved My Online Writing Process After Reading &#39;The Art And Business Of Online Writing&#39;</title>

      <description>Writing is easy. Anyone can write a post of 500 words.
But what does it take to go from a writer to becoming a writer with readers? Insights gathered by trying different things, willingness to make mistakes, and working in public.
Therefore, I always get curious when I find people who have successfully created writing careers, or businesses on top of their writing skills. This curiosity led me to read &amp;ldquo;The Art and Business of Online Writing&amp;rdquo;, by Nicolas Cole (my co-founder, Thiago Araujo, also recommended reading it).</description>

      <title>An open letter to someone who&#39;s received lots of rejections</title>
      <link>https://www.stefannibrasil.me/posts/early-career-ruby-dev-interviews/</link>

      <guid>https://www.stefannibrasil.me/posts/early-career-ruby-dev-interviews/</guid>
      <description>I know how hard it is to give everything you got for job interviews only to be rejected every time. It&amp;rsquo;s so hard to keep going because every time you get a rejection, it makes you doubt if you&amp;rsquo;re a good developer. In my experience, the feeling of not being a good developer never goes away. It&amp;rsquo;s something worth learning how to handle so it doesn&amp;rsquo;t keep sabotaging you.
Truly said, nobody wants to hire people with less than 3-5 years of experience.</description>

      <title>The One quote from &#39;Work Clean&#39; to deliver excellence as a Creator</title>

      <description>What differentiates perfectionism from excellence? I only learned the difference recently.
Reading this quote from the book &amp;ldquo;Work Clean: The life-changing power of mise-en-place to organize your life, work, and mind&amp;rdquo;, changed how I approached my work.
I used to feel proud by saying I was a perfectionist. That meant months, years of planning every single detail of everything. Setting the stakes higher as time went by.
Perfectionism is a great excuse for trying to control the results.</description>

      <description>Hi, welcome! The posts under &amp;ldquo;/notes&amp;rdquo; are just that: notes about things I&amp;rsquo;ve read or watched. I used to just write them for myself. I figured sharing them is more helpful than keeping them just to myself. Enjoy!
 Sharing a few notes about Imposter Syndrome based on the work of Dr. Vanessa Bohns and Dr. Randy Patterson.

      <description>You&amp;rsquo;re focusing on finding that first Ruby job. You&amp;rsquo;ve been practicing for months or years. You&amp;rsquo;ve been applying to entry-level jobs, even internships.
You polish your resume. Tweak your portfolio. Attach your CV. Press Submit.
Chirp, chirp, chirp 🦗
Nothing happens.
Worse: you do an amazing interview, people loved you. But then they say they are moving forward with someone else that has more experience.
Welp, next time is going to be different.</description>

      <title>The Unstuck Guide for Self-Taught Developers</title>

      <description>When you get stuck, it’s really easy to block yourself from creatively solving your problem.
You start asking &amp;ldquo;why am I so dumb?&amp;rdquo;, or thinking that you don’t have a programmer&amp;rsquo;s brain, or feeling that you’ll never understand anything.
How is that helpful? It isn’t.
The way we talk to each other (even to ourselves) impacts our performance. It’s not self-help BS. It’s how our brain works.</description>

      <description>You&amp;rsquo;re working on your coding project. Everything is going well.
But it doesn&amp;rsquo;t take too long until you get stuck on your assignment. You try everything you possibly can, with the resources you have.
You are mixing Ruby, JavaScript, Postgres. Doing crash courses, googling. You go to the docs but you don&amp;rsquo;t even know where to look. It&amp;rsquo;s almost as if it&amp;rsquo;s a foreign language.
On StackOverflow, you see the same tips over and over.</description>

      <title>Worried you don&#39;t contribute to your team as an early career software engineer?</title>

      <description>You got that first job as an early career software engineer after a long job hunt. You are ready to learn a lot and advance in your career.
Most times you&amp;rsquo;re fine, but sometimes you worry that you don&amp;rsquo;t contribute much value to your team. That you ask stupid questions all the time. Or that you don&amp;rsquo;t have the domain-specific knowledge required to estimate tickets accurately or to handle bugs quickly.</description>

      <title>How to write Badass READMES for your Github projects</title>
      <link>https://www.stefannibrasil.me/posts/github-readme-examples-and-template/</link>

      <description>You show your GitHub project to people but they don&amp;rsquo;t understand what the code is about. Why should you take time to write a good README if they can simply &amp;ldquo;read the code&amp;rdquo;?
They won&amp;rsquo;t even look at your code if you don&amp;rsquo;t explain what&amp;rsquo;s in it for them. Why should anyone care about it?
What about making them curious about your project? It saves them time, it shows you care about good communication and that by writing good docs you probably write good code as well.</description>

      <description>Let&amp;rsquo;s say you&amp;rsquo;re learning how to paint. When you look at the famous paintings at the museum, you might start asking yourself:
&amp;ldquo;Will I ever be this good? Is this for me? Will I ever get to paint something like this?&amp;rdquo;
If these questions sound familiar, it&amp;rsquo;s because you&amp;rsquo;re not alone. It&amp;rsquo;s not just you.
The same questions can be applied to coding. Some things, like painting and learning how to code, are hard.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;Why is it so difficult to find Junior Ruby on Rails dev roles?&amp;quot;
You have finished multiple online courses, workshops and might even read some books to learn Ruby. You start job hunting and you struggle to land a position because of your lack of experience.
So how do you get experience with large Ruby and Rails apps when no one wants to hire early-career devs?
It&amp;rsquo;s a tough market for any early-career dev with little to no experience, so it&amp;rsquo;s no different with Ruby.</description>

      <description>In the last Open Source Thursdays live, Thiago and I shared how we chose a few issues that looked promising for us.
By the end of the post, you&amp;rsquo;ll learn how to filter issues, and how to start contributing to Rails by reproducing a bug.
How to choose your first Ruby on Rails issue Which one from the +300 open issues should you pick? We tried breaking this process down into 2 parts: filtering them by labels, then choosing one that seems easier to fix.</description>

      <description>What is Open Source Thursdays? Open Source Thursdays is a new project from the hexdevs team, aka me and Thiago.
We started this project because we&amp;rsquo;ve always wanted to contribute to rails! So we thought, why not do it live so more people can join us? Our goal is to make open source contributions more popular.
Neither of us has done this before. The plan is to get there and do everything live, no preparing in advance.</description>

      <description>If you&amp;rsquo;re someone who decided to change careers to work as a web developer, then you might be having a hard time trying to land your first job. You aren&amp;rsquo;t alone.
We all have heard that there are tons of tech jobs in the market but there aren&amp;rsquo;t qualified professionals to fulfill them. So you go and spend days doing online courses and getting certifications so you can join the wave.</description>

      <description>Step 1: Decide to find one open-source project to contribute 😎
Step 2: Keep looking 👀
Step 3: They are all intimidating, is that normal? 😑
Step 4: What if I contributed to a project I have lots of experience with, like rails? I&amp;rsquo;d love to understand more about this tool I use every day 🤔
Step 5: OMG, the code is huge and scary, Will this even run on my machine?</description>

      <description>Ruby is keeping you interested in transitioning to the software development world. But you&amp;rsquo;re not sure you&amp;rsquo;re gonna be employable. You might have heard that you should just choose JavaScript because, you know, everyone is saying Ruby is a dying domain.
But you don&amp;rsquo;t see yourself keeping up with the Kardashians traditional JS web dev world.
You&amp;rsquo;ve heard that there are plenty of Ruby/Rails jobs out there. But how do you get your first one as an early career dev?</description>

      <title>Should you create a new Rails app as API-only?</title>

      <description>Before you get too excited and run rails new thecoolest --api on your terminal, it might be a good idea to take some time to consider what your needs are.
How different is a Rails API-only from a full-stack Rails app? As you can see in the image below, the API-only is a lighter version of a full stack Rails app:
The reason why it&amp;rsquo;s lighter is because Rails API-only won&amp;rsquo;t render HTML pages, handle user sessions &amp;amp; cookies, nor display any assets.</description>

      <description>Which authentication strategy should you use for Rails API? How to implement a secure authentication strategy is by the far the most confusing part of building an API.
It&amp;rsquo;s important to evaluate your app requirements before choosing any strategy in the first place to avoid any security implications.
To help you figure out which authentication strategy is the best for your case, here are 5 possible solutions for you:
Rails API-only If your API is running as a standalone app and you don&amp;rsquo;t need a web interface of any sort, then a header-based token auth might be enough.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;Maybe Python or Go is a better choice? Or even Javascript?&amp;rdquo; If you&amp;rsquo;ve been asking yourself these questions, this post is for you.
When I was learning how to code in 2016, Ruby on Rails was trending and every startup was using it. It was obvious that learning Rails would be an easy way to get my first dev job. We&amp;rsquo;re in 2021, though, and things have changed.
