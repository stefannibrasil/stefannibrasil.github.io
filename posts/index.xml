      <title>How to write Badass Github READMES for your projects</title>

      <description>You show your project on your GitHub portfolio to people but they don&amp;rsquo;t understand it. It&amp;rsquo;s easy to think they can simply &amp;ldquo;read the code&amp;rdquo;. You&amp;rsquo;re adding more friction to their job. Nobody likes that.
What about making them feel impressed by improving your README? It saves time, it shows you care about working in a team and that by writing good docs you probably write good code as well.</description>

      <description>Let&amp;rsquo;s say you&amp;rsquo;re learning how to paint. When you look at the famous paintings at the museum, you might start asking yourself:
&amp;ldquo;Will I ever be this good? Is this for me? Will I ever understand all of this?&amp;rdquo;
If these questions sound familiar, it&amp;rsquo;s because you&amp;rsquo;re not alone. It&amp;rsquo;s not just you.
Believe it or not, the same questions can be applied to coding. Some things, like painting and learning how to code, are hard.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;Why is it so difficult to find Junior Ruby on Rails dev roles?&amp;quot;
You have finished multiple online courses, workshops and might even read some books to learn Ruby. You start job hunting and you struggle to land a position because of your lack of experience.
So how do you get experience with large Ruby and Rails apps when no one wants to hire early-career devs?
It&amp;rsquo;s a tough market for any early-career dev with little to no experience, so it&amp;rsquo;s no different with Ruby.</description>

      <description>In the last Open Source Thursdays live, Thiago and I shared how we chose a few issues that looked promising for us.
By the end of the post, you&amp;rsquo;ll learn how to filter issues, and how to start contributing to Rails by reproducing a bug.
How to choose your first Ruby on Rails issue Which one from the +300 open issues should you pick? We tried breaking this process down into 2 parts: filtering them by labels, then choosing one that seems easier to fix.</description>

      <description>What is Open Source Thursdays? Open Source Thursdays is a new project from the hexdevs team, aka me and Thiago.
We started this project because we&amp;rsquo;ve always wanted to contribute to rails! So we thought, why not do it live so more people can join us? Our goal is to make open source contributions more popular.
Neither of us has done this before. The plan is to get there and do everything live, no preparing in advance.</description>

      <description>If you&amp;rsquo;re someone who decided to change careers to work as a web developer, then you might be having a hard time trying to land your first job. You aren&amp;rsquo;t alone.
We all have heard that there are tons of tech jobs in the market but there aren&amp;rsquo;t qualified professionals to fulfill them. So you go and spend days doing online courses and getting certifications so you can join the wave.</description>

      <description>Step 1: Decide to find one open-source project to contribute 😎
Step 2: Keep looking 👀
Step 3: They are all intimidating, is that normal? 😑
Step 4: What if I contributed to a project I have lots of experience with, like rails? I&amp;rsquo;d love to understand more about this tool I use every day 🤔
Step 5: OMG, the code is huge and scary, Will this even run on my machine?</description>

      <description>Ruby is keeping you interested in transitioning to the software development world. But you&amp;rsquo;re not sure you&amp;rsquo;re gonna be employable. You might have heard that you should just choose JavaScript because, you know, everyone is saying Ruby is a dying domain.
But you don&amp;rsquo;t see yourself keeping up with the Kardashians traditional JS web dev world.
You&amp;rsquo;ve heard that there are plenty of Ruby/Rails jobs out there. But how do you get your first one as an early career dev?</description>

      <title>Should you create a new Rails app as API-only?</title>
      <link>https://www.stefannibrasil.me/posts/should-you-go-with-rails-api-only/</link>

      <description>Before you get too excited and run rails new thecoolest --api on your terminal, it might be a good idea to take some time to consider what your needs are.
How different is a Rails API-only from a full-stack Rails app? As you can see in the image below, the API-only is a lighter version of a full stack Rails app:
The reason why it&amp;rsquo;s lighter is because Rails API-only won&amp;rsquo;t render HTML pages, handle user sessions &amp;amp; cookies, nor display any assets.</description>

      <description>Which authentication strategy should you use for Rails API? How to implement a secure authentication strategy is by the far the most confusing part of building an API.
It&amp;rsquo;s important to evaluate your app requirements before choosing any strategy in the first place to avoid any security implications.
To help you figure out which authentication strategy is the best for your case, here are 5 possible solutions for you:
Rails API-only If your API is running as a standalone app and you don&amp;rsquo;t need a web interface of any sort, then a header-based token auth might be enough.</description>

      <title>Balancing present and future with the FIRE movement</title>

      <description>The first time I realized I was being too future-focused was when I got in a bad mental health state in 2020.
I didn’t want to pay for Cognitive-Behavior Therapy sessions. I could have, but I didn’t want to spend money on it. Not super clever, I know.
Looking back, I get mad at myself for putting savings before my mental health needs. This experience changed me, since it took me less than one year to improve my mental health, live a happier and confident life.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;Maybe Python or Go is a better choice? Or even Javascript?&amp;rdquo; If you&amp;rsquo;ve been asking yourself these questions, this post is for you.
When I was learning how to code in 2016, Ruby on Rails was trending and every startup was using it. It was obvious that learning Rails would be an easy way to get my first dev job. We&amp;rsquo;re in 2021, though, and things have changed.
The answer to &amp;ldquo;Is Rails still relevant?</description>
