You‚Äôve been practicing for months or years. You‚Äôve been applying to entry-level jobs, even internships.\nYou polish your resume. Tweak your portfolio. Attach your CV. Press Submit.\nChirp, chirp, chirp ü¶ó\nNothing happens.\nWorse: you do an amazing interview, people loved you. But then they say they are moving forward with someone else that has more experience.\nWelp, next time is going to be different. Keep hoping for the best.\nYou ask yourself: ‚ÄúShould I just keep practicing and building my portfolio?‚Äù ü§î\nThat may sound like a good idea. After all, no one will say no to you when you show your perfect portfolio that you‚Äôve been crafting for the past months, right?\nWrong.\nWhen you get a no and people say you don‚Äôt have experience, they are mostly asking themselves this question:\n Are you recommended by someone I know?\n It‚Äôs just how humans work. We are wired to confirm our biases. We don‚Äôt like uncertainty and unfamiliarity.\nIf you look closely, there are people out there getting jobs without experience. Some of them are far less skilled than you. Lack of experience is not the only problem.\nBut what else can you do to get experience and recommendations for your first Ruby dev job?\nDid you ever think about getting experience by doing volunteer work? I know, working for free doesn‚Äôt sound good.\nBut your current strategy sucks. You‚Äôre still reading this post because you are not sure what else you can do. Deep inside, you know just practicing isn‚Äôt the answer.\nBy the time you get to the end of this post, you‚Äôll know how to get out of the Dev With No Experience Roller Coaster‚Ñ¢ by strategically doing volunteer work.\nGet real-world experience with volunteer work  ‚ÄúVolunteer work is one of the best ways there is to get your feet wet and gain experience in a new field. You don‚Äôt need credentials or prior experience. You don‚Äôt have to pay them a cent for your training. [‚Ä¶] Volunteer work is the great cure for the classic vicious cycle, ‚ÄòCan‚Äôt get experience without a job; can‚Äôt get a job without experience.' If you think unpaid experience doesn‚Äôt count on a resume, think again. Experience is experience.‚Äù ‚Äî Wishcraft, by Barbara Sher. Unfortunately, not everyone has the privilege of working without getting paid. Therefore, this strategy doesn‚Äôt work for everyone.\nBut if you‚Äôve been investing your time and resources into practicing your coding skills by doing one workshop/course/tutorial after another, then you do have the time and resources to get real-world experience by doing volunteer work.\nIt‚Äôs not that investing in Education is bad! Improving your skills is necessary and will get you further. Study and also volunteer.\nI‚Äôve heard countless examples of people that were offered great opportunities after they have done volunteer work. One of my first job opportunities came from volunteering to be a coach at a Rails Girls workshop. I also volunteered for non-profit projects.\nWhen you‚Äôre a helpful, reliable, and motivated person, people will trust and advocate for you. You might not even need to apply for jobs. People will want to work with you because you have experience helping others.\nEverything you don‚Äôt get by building yet another project and practicing your coding skills in the controlled environment you‚Äôre trapping yourself in.\nHow to get started with volunteering Don‚Äôt know any organizations/projects that you can reach out to get started? I didn‚Äôt as well! I asked some friends around and I got this list for you:\n  Contribute to an open-source project. I‚Äôve heard good things about CASA;\n  Build an app for a project in your local community;\n  Volunteer at non-profits. These are great ones to help you get started:\n Ruby for Good - A non-profit organizations to build an inclusive technology community, and provide technology-focused educational opportunities to underserved communities; MPKAT - A not-for-profit diversity community initiative. They provide a network for growth and healing through resources, discussion, supportive relationships, and opportunities; Tech for Good - In general, lots of communities called ‚Äútech for good‚Äù are a good place to start. Code for America - Each city has brigades of people with a range of skills, and they organize those people to work on software/tools to benefit civic/nonprofit orgs in that city; Code for Philly - Code for Philly is a very successful brigade from a larger organization called The Brigade Network.    Ask around and you will find out people who successfully followed this strategy. Study their trajectory and follow their steps. I‚Äôm happy to chat, if you want!\n  Note: if you notice that you are taking a long time choosing one from the list, set a 15min timer to make a decision. It‚Äôs not important that you find the perfect one for you. Just get started. See how it goes. If it doesn‚Äôt work out, try another one. You‚Äôll get confidence by taking action, not by overthinking. Deal? üôã‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è\nAnother note: Keep in mind that it‚Äôs possible that people have expectations that you know how solve most of the problems on your own. Everyone is probably solving their own problems and that requires too much already. That doesn‚Äôt mean you should know how to solve them, though. You‚Äôre learning and having support is part of the process. Make sure to find a group that can help you along the way. It‚Äôs okay to ask for help Let‚Äôs be clear: no strategy can guarantee you a job. There is no guarantee for anything. But if you want to get different results and maximize your opportunities, then volunteering is a great way to build your new career.\nMeet people that will advocate for you. Meet people that you can help with the skills you have to create valuable work. Show the world what you got.\nTo quote Barbara Sher (again):\n Volunteering is one of the best ways to get out there now.\n Get out there. Help someone by volunteering your time and skills and start making things happen for you.\nYou got this üí™.\nPS.
