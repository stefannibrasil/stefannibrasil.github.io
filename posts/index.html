				<p>I believe that we live our everyday lives without actually reflecting on our habits and why we do things the way we always do. Have you ever wondered about that?
For example, why do we go to school for more than 10 years and are required to sit down all day and just act as we are told? Why do we keep a 40-hour week as the standard way of working even now when we use our brains more than our hands to work?  … </p>

			<div class="post-content">
				<p>It took me at least almost 30 years to finally live in peace with depression and anxiety. I honestly didn&rsquo;t believe I would still be alive at this age. I&rsquo;m relieved life started to be something I&rsquo;m not angry at anymore all the time. That I can say is my greatest lesson from this year!
Besides that, it&rsquo;s amazing the number of things that I&rsquo;m happy to share:
 I started a podcast called hexdevs.  … </p>

			<div class="post-content">
				<p>Today I listened to this Canadian Couch Potato podcast episode. It was a talk with Dr. Steve Wendel on the Investor Success.
The episode, besides the great content, caught my attention when Dr. Wendel mentioned that financial advisors and their clients have different expectations from each other.
They discussed research showing that financial advisors have high expectations that their clients, beyond other goals, were counting on them to avoid making bad investments decisions.  … </p>

				<p>Everyone who is in debt today (and originally didn’t plan to be), once thought they would be able to pay it back in a few years.
 Everyone who (unfortunately) died climbing the everest, once thought they were prepared to reach the peak.
  Not that i’m the first one to think that, but this insight does not come to us naturally. The first book that i read about the way we think was Thinking, fast and slow.  … </p>

			<div class="post-content">
				<p>I’ve been thinking of switching my blog to Hugo for a while. The main reason for that is because I’ve changed a lot since I first started writing on my previous wordpress blog. My interests have changed a lot and I think it’s time to move to something new.
I intend to discuss more about different interests, not just about software. That said, you can expect to find here posts about books, financial independence, living a more healthy lifestyle, including adopting environmental-friendly habits, investments, immigrating, and projects that i’m working on as I build them.  … </p>
