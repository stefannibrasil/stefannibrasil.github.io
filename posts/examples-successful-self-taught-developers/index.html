When you look at the famous paintings at the museum, you might start asking yourself:\n‚ÄúWill I ever be this good? Is this for me? Will I ever understand all of this?‚Äù\nIf these questions sound familiar, it‚Äôs because you‚Äôre not alone. It‚Äôs not just you.\nBelieve it or not, the same questions can be applied to coding. Some things, like painting and learning how to code, are hard. Transitioning into tech is hard.\nIn case you need a boost of inspiration and to be reminded that it‚Äôs possible to make it happen, here‚Äôs a list of a few successful Rails developers that come from unusual backgrounds.\nEileen Utchichetlle How many photographers do you know that have turned out to be developers? Eileen is one of them! She has a BFA in Photography and she worked on magazine layout, email marketing, as well as editing as a Production Designer for 2 years before she decided to change her career.\nShe‚Äôs now a Principal Software Engineer at GitHub. She‚Äôs also a member of the Rails Core Team and the Rails Security Team.\nEileen has given lots of talks and keynotes, despite being afraid of public speaking!\nAndromeda Yelton Andromeda is a librarian and technologist. She used to work as a math major and a middle school Latin teacher. Eventually, she got a library degree and ended up working in a library technology startup.\nShe transitioned into web development by doing software contract work (Python/Django) to help librarians learn to code through teaching, speaking, and writing.\nShe‚Äôs now a full-time software engineer, building things that empower people through code. She inspires others to combine their skills to bring more perspectives to the software world.\nLovisa Svallingson (in memoriam) This is how Lovisa described her skills:\n‚ÄúWith a background in languages, working with people, and various creative endeavors, I bring a unique and well-rounded perspective to the work I do‚Äù.\nLovisa‚Äôs background was in languages and she was an English teacher. Later on, she attended the Turing School of Software and Design.\nLovisa passed away and I want to dedicate this post in her honor. She was a Bootcamp graduate‚Äôs Advocate and she wanted to help more people who are transitioning into tech, just like you.\nMay her time here on Earth be an example that your diverse background is your strength.\nDr. Barbara Oakley Note: cheating a bit here because Dr. Oakley is not a Rails developer but consider this a bonus material :)\nDr. Barbara has a B.A. in Slavic Languages and Literature. Later on, she decided to study Engineering.\nShe has written lots of books about how to learn effectively, all backed up by Neuroscience. She is the creator of the most famous MOOC free course called Learning how to Learn.\nShe‚Äôs an advocate of having multiple backgrounds as it can give you more insights on your new journey.\nChanging careers signals that you‚Äôre constantly learning new things! It‚Äôs an example that learning is part of your lifestyle. You‚Äôre being mentally flexible.\n What do they all have in common? It took them years to get where they are today. But they all started somewhere and they embraced their diversity. I‚Äôm pretty sure they once felt the same as you.\nTake a deep breath now. Can you imagine all the great things you will accomplish after you become a developer? The world is big enough for your ambitions, keep going!\nIf you still need some extra inspiration, I highly recommend you watching this amazing Ted Talk from Amy Cuddy called Your body language may shape who you are. Go check it out.\nI hope you‚Äôre feeling a bit more relaxed and inspired!
