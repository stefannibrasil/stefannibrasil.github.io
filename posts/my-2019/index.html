		<div class="post-content"><p>It took me at least almost 30 years to finally live in peace with depression and anxiety.
I honestly didn&rsquo;t believe I would still be alive at this age. I&rsquo;m relieved life started
to be something I&rsquo;m not angry at anymore all the time. That I can say is my greatest lesson from this year!</p>

<p>Besides that, it&rsquo;s amazing the number of things that I&rsquo;m happy to share:</p>

<ul>
<li>I started a podcast called <a href="https://www.hexdevs.com">hexdevs</a>.</li>
<li>I started working full time as a Software Developer in a cool local company.</li>
<li>Our savings rate this year was 57%. We continue to invest with <a href="www.wealthbar.com/r/4eanghbm">WealthBar</a>, but we also
started investing with <a href="https://www.questrade.com/?refid=5dcac53c1b833">Questrade</a> and <a href="https://my.lendingloop.ca/lenders/new-lender?code=d78432">Lending Loop</a>.</li>
<li>I read <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/63494595-stefanni-brasil">20 books</a>.</li>
<li>My husband and I became permanent residents of Canada!</li>
<li>We both started eating a plant-based diet in November. Feeling better like never, I even lost
some weight that I wasn&rsquo;t expecting. I wake up every day with energy, don&rsquo;t feel hungry all the
time anymore and my body feels happy about it. It also feels great not contributing to the animal
industry anymore.</li>
<li>I became a co-organizer of the <a href="https://www.meetup.com/Indie-Hackers-Vancouver">Indie Hackers</a> meetup in Vancouver.</li>
</ul>

<p>It was an amazing year, for sure, but I want to plan for less in 2020. Fewer projects, less pressure on myself,
less energy on what is not important to me. Instead, I want to focus on one thing at a time,
enjoy the moment and enjoy life without anxiety and depression.</p>

<p>May 2020 be a good year, whatever it brings to us.</p>

<p>Happy 2020!</p>
