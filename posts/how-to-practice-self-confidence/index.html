Decide. What kills overconfidence is overthinking. Keep deciding, as if your life depends on it. If it helps, write down the consequences of your decision, and think through it with a rational perspective. What do you have to lose? Is probably less than you think. Fail fast. Learn. Keep trying. This process builds thicker skin. You‚Äôll get more confident by trying, not from getting perfect on the first try. Perfection is the killer of great things. Take risks. Afraid of failing? So what! Do it either way. Confidence-boost is a habit. Risk keeps you on life‚Äôs edge. It keeps you growing, inspiring, and gaining confidence. Turn your fear into an ally. Fear is a powerful feeling. Instead of letting it stop you, can you imagine using that force to get you moving towards what you want? Break your big goals into small actionable goals. When facing big challenges, battle feelings of being overwhelmed by breaking them down. Something as simple as writing down a to-do list works. Practice self-compassion. When things don‚Äôt go as you expected, it‚Äôs the perfect moment to practice self-compassion. The central precept of self-compassion is that we should all be kinder to ourselves because doing so makes us healthier, more fulfilled, and more successful in the pursuits we choose. Name your inner negative voices. I started naming my negative voices: Judge Judy, Pam Planner. This helps me handle my cognitive distortions better. Once I identify who my voices are, I can say ‚Äúthanks, Pam, but we‚Äôll be fine!‚Äù. By the way, if your name is Judy or Pam, feel free to use my name for your voices :P. Start a Thought Record Journal. When you get yourself too overwhelmed by your cognitive distortions, add them to a Thought Record. Why does it work? It shows you that your thoughts are way less powerful than you think at first. Making them ‚Äòreal‚Äô gives you an analytical perspective of the situation, and you realize it‚Äôs not that a big deal. Try it next time. Here‚Äôs a template to help you get started.  Somedays I have to practice them TWICE. But it gets easier every time üèãÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è.\nWhy does my brain try to sabotage me? üß† Nerdy as I am, I needed to understand why my brain was my biggest enemy.\nWell, it turns out it‚Äôs because our brain hasn‚Äôt evolved as we imagine.\nIt still thinks we live in the wild, and it‚Äôs trying to save us from predators. So I learned that my brain was just excessively trying to protect me. There‚Äôs danger in doing different things.\nSince our predators have changed, this protection is not well suited for our modern society anymore. If not recognized, our fear of getting out of our comfort zone can stop us from achieving great things.\nNow that you‚Äôve got this information, every time you get yourself doubting yourself, take it as an opportunity to be grateful for recognizing this moment and say:\n Thanks, my primitive brain, for your concern, but I got this üí™\n Resources The Confidence Code: The Science and Art of Self-Assurance - What women should know*\nRadical Acceptance: Awakening the Love That Heals Fear and Shame\nFeeling Good: The New Mood Therapy\nCognitive Behavioral Therapy\nHow to practice Mindfulness\n*I strongly recommend it to anyone interested in understanding why women suffer more from lack of confidence, and how everyone can help solving this issue.\n","wordCount":"650","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://www.stefannibrasil.me/images/how-to-become-more-confident.png","datePublished":"2021-01-28T10:36:51-08:00","dateModified":"2021-04-01T21:27:12-07:00","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Stefanni Brasil"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.stefannibrasil.me/posts/how-to-practice-self-confidence/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Stefanni Brasil","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://www.stefannibrasil.me/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>if(localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"){document.body.classList.add('dark');}else if(localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"){document.body.classList.remove('dark')}else if(window.matchMedia('(prefers-color-scheme: dark)').matches){document.body.classList.add('dark');}</script><noscript><style type=text/css>.theme-toggle,.top-link{display:none}</style></noscript><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://www.stefannibrasil.me/ accesskey=h title="Stefanni Brasil (Alt + H)">Stefanni Brasil</a>
