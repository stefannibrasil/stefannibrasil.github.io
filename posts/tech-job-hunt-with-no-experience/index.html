You ‚Ä¶","keywords":["ruby on rails","early career devs"],"articleBody":"‚ÄúWhy is it so difficult to find Junior Ruby on Rails dev roles?\"\nYou have finished multiple online courses, workshops and might even read some books to learn Ruby. You start job hunting and you struggle to land a position because of your lack of experience.\nSo how do you get experience with large Ruby and Rails apps when no one wants to hire early-career devs?\nIt‚Äôs a tough market for any early-career dev with little to no experience, so it‚Äôs no different with Ruby. You‚Äôre not alone, my friend!\nIf you don‚Äôt know what else you can do besides doing another tutorial or starting another small Ruby project, here‚Äôs an idea for you: contribute to Rails.\n‚ÄúWait, what? Me? Contribute to Rails? I‚Äôm just starting my career!‚Äù\nI know. This is not usually recommended as a beginner-friendly open source project but here‚Äôs something you probably haven‚Äôt thought about yet.\nWhat if you learned Ruby on Rails from the source? Now that you have done tiny apps it‚Äôs time to try something different.\nRails can be daunting. It‚Äôs so abstract and complex. I feel the same!\nHowever, just by lurking around you‚Äôll see how a large project is designed and maintained.\nThis might not seem like it‚Äôs important but you‚Äôll be learning how to:\n read other people‚Äôs code; read documentation; write good documentation, commits, and Pull Requests; navigate in a large codebase; ask for and do code reviews; improve your communication skills (super important for remote jobs);  Believe it not, these things are what you‚Äôll be doing most of the time as a developer.\nYou will have a better understanding of the tool you‚Äôre using every day. Can you imagine how cool it can be to use those skills on your projects? Interesting topics to discuss on interviews, huh?\nHow does this approach help me get a job? Although this won‚Äôt guarantee you‚Äôll land a job soon, it certainly will help you develop competitive advantages. A few examples:\n Apply your lessons on your projects (great for your portfolio!); Write blog posts or present a talk teaching others how to understand a specific module; You will feel like a badass! Plus, it‚Äôs a way to show you have good initiative; Some companies allow skipping the whiteboard interview if you have interesting open-source contributions; You‚Äôll be connected with more experienced/expert Ruby devs; You‚Äôll be putting yourself out there instead of just learning on your own.  But first, you need to get started.\nHow to get started with contributing to Rails Go to the Rails GitHub repository. Choose one module. ActionPack, for example, is a good option because it doesn‚Äôt require any database drivers configuration.\nChoose one merged Pull Request (suggestions: this or this one) to get started. You probably won‚Äôt understand either of the PRs. Don‚Äôt panic, that‚Äôs expected! Keep reading.\nWhen you take a look at the PRs, you‚Äôre not expected to understand the changes. The goal is to ask yourself: Why were the changes were made? How did the author approach it? How was the code review given? Was the author a regular contributor? Did the issue have reproducible steps?\nWhat can you learn from it? Nothing is a valid answer although I‚Äôm pretty sure you at least learned that it‚Äôs not beginner-friendly. That‚Äôs something, right?\nYou can even go one step further: could you learn a thing or two about Ruby? Is it touching the controllers, the models, the views? What is the context?\nRinse and repeat until you feel like you‚Äôre starting to understand how things are done on the project. It‚Äôs going to take some time.\nEventually, you‚Äôll feel more confident to work on an issue. However, when you go through the Rails documentation, you‚Äôll know this is just one of many ways to contribute to the project üòâ.\nBut Rails is scary! What if I get stuck all the time? It‚Äôs going to be difficult. Remember: Rails is super hard. But the goal is not to aim to understand it for now. The goal is to get familiar with large codebases, learning how to find yourself in a new codebase, seeing how people ask questions, give code reviews, reading the docs.\nThese are normal things you‚Äôll do on the day-to-day as a developer. It‚Äôs a good opportunity to practice asking good questions and learn how to get unstuck. These are valuable skills for your career.\nGive it a try. Set an event on your calendar to do this for at least 1 hour every week. Write down your progress, celebrate every tiny lesson, and see what happens.\n Did you like this article?
