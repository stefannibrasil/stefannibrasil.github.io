I felt hostage to coffee: if I didnâ€™t drink it every morning, Iâ€™d get a terrible headache, forcing me to drink it to avoid being in pain. It also made me feel more anxious during the day. Why was I doing this to myself?\nWhen I had to leave early and didnâ€™t have time for drinking coffee, I would seek out for coffee right away. And it had to be before 11am to avoid messing up with my sleep. Except that I donâ€™t like the idea of paying almost 10 bucks for a coffee drink.\nWhat I liked about drinking coffee in the morning was that it was a ritual. Iâ€™d drink in the morning while journaling, reading, or studying, a cue for focus and instropection.\nI never really liked coffee that much â€“ it was an acquired taste. It was a matter of replacing the drink and keeping the ritual. Thatâ€™s how I embarked on a caffeine-free journey.\nCaffeine-free drinks experiments My husband was the first one who stopped drinking coffee to help with his sleep. I joined him a few months after, trying a few things along the way. Eventually, I got so sensitive to caffeine that even drinking decaf regular coffee would keep me awake at night .The most obvious first experiment was loose leaf/sachet teas. I tried lots of them but didnâ€™t click for me. I had to try something else.\nI then found out the caffeine-free powder products from Blume, a Canadian brand. I have tried almost all of their latte powder (my favourites are the Blue Lavender and Beetroot blends). I highly recommend trying them out! If you try them, buy directly from their website instead of Amazon to support Canadian businesses :)\nEventually, my husband bought a bag of Chicory Root. I tried once and it was horrible. Continued drinking Blume until I decided I wanted to spend less with this daily part of my life. For comparison, I now buy the roasted Chicory root in bulk at my local refillery and it costs around 22 bucks for ~420g. It lasts 2-3 months, depending on how many servings we drink per day.\nI decided to try Chicory Coffee again. And I finally decided to research how to acquire the taste for it. I was committed to ditching caffeine for once and all.\nHow I make Chicory Coffee We have a small espresso machine with a manual milk frother. I always had coffee with frothed milk, so I thought it would be nice to try that with Chicory Root coffee.\nAnd voila! Iâ€™ve been experimenting with different variations and itâ€™s been part of my morning ritual.\nHereâ€™s how I do it:\nI brew a concentrated batch of chicory root tea for the week:\n for a glass of hot water, I add 3-4 tablespoons of chicory root drain store the chicory coffee in a glass on the fridge  When I am ready to drink, I pour a bit of the concentrated coffee in a cup, sweeten it to taste, froth my soy or oat milk and add a dash of cinnamon on top.\nI realized it was may more efficient to brew a batch like this instead of brewing it every day. I learned this after visiting Italy this Summer, where I found a few coffee shops offereing Chicory Cappucino. How cool is that?!\n The best part of drinking chicory root, and other coffee alternatives, is that I can drink them all day, anytime of the day without messing up with my sleep. And spending less ;)\nNext, I want to explore dandellion coffee which is suposed to be similar to chicory. I have seen some local stores selling instant dandellion coffee but similar to coffee, buying the roasted version and brewing it yourself must certainly taste better.\nIf youâ€™ve been thinking of expanding your drink menu outside of coffee, I hope you got some inspiration to try some new things.
