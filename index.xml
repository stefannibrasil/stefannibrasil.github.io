      <description>Which authentication strategy should you use for Rails API? How to implement a secure authentication strategy is by the far the most confusing part of building an API.
It&amp;rsquo;s extremely important to evaluate your app requirements before choosing any strategy in the first place to avoid any security implications.
There&amp;rsquo;s nothing worse than having to turn your entire Rails API-only into a regular Rails app because midway you realized you needed an OAuth authentication code flow or have an interface for your users, right?</description>

      <description>The first time I realized I was being too future-focused was when I got in a bad mental health state in 2020.
I didn‚Äôt want to pay for Cognitive-Behavior Therapy sessions. I could have, but I didn‚Äôt want to spend money on it.
Looking back, I get mad at myself for putting savings before my mental health needs. This experience changed me, since it took me less than one year to improve my mental health, live a happier and confident life.</description>

      <description>Are you thinking of investing your time learning Ruby on Rails but you&amp;rsquo;re not sure you&amp;rsquo;re gonna find a job? Then this post is for you.
When I was learning how to code in 2016, Ruby on Rails was trending and every startup was using it. It was obvious that learning Rails would be an easy way to get my first dev job.
But that was more than 4 years ago.</description>
