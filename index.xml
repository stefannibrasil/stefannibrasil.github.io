      <description>Hello, I’m stefanni.
I’m originally from brazil but i’ve been living in Vancouver, BC since 2018.
I’m a software developer working at Lendesk, and currently bootstrapping a side-project called hexdevs with my partner Thiago Araujo. If you are a developer and are interested in working remotely (or how to work remotely more efficiently), finding a job abroad, starting a side business or just getting better as a professional, check us out and let us know what do you think.</description>

      <description>I’ve been thinking of switching my blog to Hugo for a while. The main reason for that is because I’ve changed a lot since I first started writing on my previous wordpress blog. My interests have changed a lot and I think it’s time to move to something new.
I intend to discuss more about different interests, not just about software. That said, you can expect to find here posts about books, financial independence, living a more healthy lifestyle, including adopting environmental-friendly habits, investments, immigrating, and projects that i’m working on as I build them.</description>
