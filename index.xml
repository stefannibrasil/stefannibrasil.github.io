      <description> Meters and meters away from home  I find myself where there‚Äôs no time   I opened the window for fresh air  As I am in complete darkness   That‚Äôs when Darkness itself entered the room  An ancient caregiver of the land and time  It just stands there, occupying its space  Indistinguishable from its friend, the night   When you seek darkness  it&#39;s because you&#39;ve trapped your light inside   And there it lies, waiting for you to wake up  Blind, looking for the outside morning light that never comes </description>

      <title>My Coffee-free Journey: Mastering Chicory Root Coffee</title>

      <description>More than one year ago, I decided that coffee (caffeine in general) wasn&amp;rsquo;t making me any good. I felt hostage to coffee: if I didn&amp;rsquo;t drink it every morning, I&amp;rsquo;d get a terrible headache, forcing me to drink it to avoid being in pain. It also made me feel more anxious during the day. Why was I doing this to myself?
When I had to leave early and didn&amp;rsquo;t have time for drinking coffee, I would seek out for coffee right away.</description>

      <description>One day, Roselyn got home and knew even before she opened the door that the cats were hungry. She had been late that day, and the cats have no problem in letting her know how impatiently they have been waiting for her. After feeding the cats and heating some leftovers to feed herself, she noticed there were two other cats in her home.
Two shadows that looked exactly like cats, to be more precise.</description>

      <title>2024: reflections on the moral obligations of being a better person</title>

      <description>Last year when visiting my local library (something that I love to do), an intriguing book cover caught my attention. It had a bright yellow cover with an interesting title: How to Be Perfect: The Correct Moral Answer to Every Question, from Michael Schur.
I checked it out without any questioning. It explains the process Michael went through to produce one of my favorite TV shows: &amp;ldquo;The Good Place&amp;rdquo;. If you have ever watched shows produced by Michael Schur, you might antecipate that the book is funny.</description>

      <description>The wind, with no excuses and surprises, takes over all the leaves from the trees.
One day, I was walking somewhere and witnessed the wind taking the remaining leaves of a tree. All I could think of was:
&amp;ldquo;wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be great if I could let things go just like that? A strong wind meets my past, removes all that doesn&amp;rsquo;t serve me anymore. For some time, I don&amp;rsquo;t carry anything, just nurture the roots of my core self to give space for a new season&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <title>Human-friendly Customer Services List</title>

      <description>The bar for offering customer service that doesn&amp;rsquo;t suck is extremely low these days.
Nothing can be more frustrating than needing to speak with a person, only to have to waste time talking to a chatbot. Or, after getting past the chatbot, get frustrated with the lack of attention from the support team.
In a world where AI (cough cough) is the answer for every problem, attentive customer service and human touch are what I desperately crave.</description>

      <title>Asking for Help Can Be Hard -- Here is How to Make it Easier</title>
      <link>https://www.stefannibrasil.me/posts/notes/asking-for-help/</link>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;I am having a hard time asking for help at my new job.&amp;rdquo;
After a couple of hours of being stuck, I sent that message to my friend, Caroline.
I shared how hard it was for me to be in a place surrounded by talented people. How I felt like I was not worthy of being there. I needed help but I didn‚Äôt want to show I needed help.
After all, if I were good enough, I should have known how to solve the problem!</description>

      <title>My Experience With Anxiety, Depression, Therapy and Taking Anti-Depressants</title>

      <guid>https://www.stefannibrasil.me/posts/my-experience-with-anti-depressants/</guid>
      <description>When I decided to start Cognitive-Behavior Therapy (CBT), I embarked on a quest: I wanted to find out why my brain was my enemy.
I didn&amp;rsquo;t get it. If my brain&amp;rsquo;s goal was to keep me alive, why was I wanting to not be alive anymore? It didn&amp;rsquo;t make sense.
I wanted to find out what was wrong with my brain.
After years of therapy, meditation, and neuroscience research, I got to the conclusion that there was nothing wrong with me.</description>

      <title>Why you don&#39;t need to feel confident to be successful</title>
      <link>https://www.stefannibrasil.me/posts/notes/attention-performance-peter-haberl/</link>

      <guid>https://www.stefannibrasil.me/posts/notes/attention-performance-peter-haberl/</guid>
      <description>Nothing kills confidence more than waiting to feel confident to do something.
You will be waiting forever. Attention and Determination is what you need to achieve your goals &amp;ndash; no matter how scary they are.
Learning about the power of Attention and Determination made me fall in love with this series about achievement orientation from the First Person Plural podcast. It&amp;rsquo;s one of my favorite podcasts (after hexdevs, of course ;).</description>

      <title>The 3 Things That Improved My Online Writing Process After Reading &#39;The Art And Business Of Online Writing&#39;</title>
      <link>https://www.stefannibrasil.me/posts/notes/the-art-and-business-of-online-writing/</link>

      <description>Writing is easy. Anyone can write a post of 500 words.
But what does it take to go from a writer to becoming a writer with readers? Insights gathered by trying different things, willingness to make mistakes, and working in public.
Therefore, I always get curious when I find people who have successfully created writing careers, or businesses on top of their writing skills. This curiosity led me to read &amp;ldquo;The Art and Business of Online Writing&amp;rdquo;, by Nicolas Cole (my co-founder, Thiago Araujo, also recommended reading it).</description>

      <title>An open letter to someone who&#39;s received lots of rejections</title>
      <link>https://www.stefannibrasil.me/posts/early-career-ruby-dev-interviews/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 30 Mar 2022 17:06:33 -0700</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://www.stefannibrasil.me/posts/early-career-ruby-dev-interviews/</guid>
      <description>I know how hard it is to give everything you got for job interviews only to be rejected every time. It&amp;rsquo;s so hard to keep going because every time you get a rejection, it makes you doubt if you&amp;rsquo;re a good developer. In my experience, the feeling of not being a good developer never goes away. It&amp;rsquo;s something worth learning how to handle so it doesn&amp;rsquo;t keep sabotaging you.
Truly said, nobody wants to hire people with less than 3-5 years of experience.</description>

      <title>The One quote from &#39;Work Clean&#39; to deliver excellence as a Creator</title>
      <link>https://www.stefannibrasil.me/posts/notes/work-clean-mise-en-place/</link>

      <guid>https://www.stefannibrasil.me/posts/notes/work-clean-mise-en-place/</guid>
      <description>What differentiates perfectionism from excellence? I only learned the difference recently.
Reading this quote from the book &amp;ldquo;Work Clean: The life-changing power of mise-en-place to organize your life, work, and mind&amp;rdquo;, changed how I approached my work.
I used to feel proud by saying I was a perfectionist. That meant months, years of planning every single detail of everything. Setting the stakes higher as time went by.
Perfectionism is a great excuse for trying to control the results.</description>

      <description>Hi, welcome! The posts under &amp;ldquo;/notes&amp;rdquo; are just that: notes about things I&amp;rsquo;ve read or watched. I used to just write them for myself. I figured sharing them is more helpful than keeping them just to myself. Enjoy!
 Sharing a few notes about Imposter Syndrome based on the work of Dr. Vanessa Bohns and Dr. Randy Patterson.

      <title>Dev With No Experience? Here&#39;s one way to get experience today.</title>

      <description>You&amp;rsquo;re focusing on finding that first Ruby job. You&amp;rsquo;ve been practicing for months or years. You&amp;rsquo;ve been applying to entry-level jobs, even internships.
You polish your resume. Tweak your portfolio. Attach your CV. Press Submit.
Chirp, chirp, chirp ü¶ó
Nothing happens.
Worse: you do an amazing interview, people loved you. But then they say they are moving forward with someone else that has more experience.
Welp, next time is going to be different.</description>

      <title>The Unstuck Guide for Self-Taught Developers</title>

      <guid>https://www.stefannibrasil.me/posts/unstuck-guide-self-taught-devs/</guid>
      <description>When you get stuck, it‚Äôs really easy to block yourself from creatively solving your problem.
You start asking &amp;ldquo;why am I so dumb?&amp;rdquo;, or thinking that you don‚Äôt have a programmer&amp;rsquo;s brain, or feeling that you‚Äôll never understand anything.
How is that helpful? It isn‚Äôt.
The way we talk to each other (even to ourselves) impacts our performance. It‚Äôs not self-help BS. It‚Äôs how our brain works.</description>

      <description>You&amp;rsquo;re working on your coding project. Everything is going well.
But it doesn&amp;rsquo;t take too long until you get stuck on your assignment. You try everything you possibly can, with the resources you have.
You are mixing Ruby, JavaScript, Postgres. Doing crash courses, googling. You go to the docs but you don&amp;rsquo;t even know where to look. It&amp;rsquo;s almost as if it&amp;rsquo;s a foreign language.
On StackOverflow, you see the same tips over and over.</description>

      <title>Worried you don&#39;t contribute to your team as an early career software engineer?</title>

      <description>You got that first job as an early career software engineer after a long job hunt. You are ready to learn a lot and advance in your career.
Most times you&amp;rsquo;re fine, but sometimes you worry that you don&amp;rsquo;t contribute much value to your team. That you ask stupid questions all the time. Or that you don&amp;rsquo;t have the domain-specific knowledge required to estimate tickets accurately or to handle bugs quickly.</description>

      <title>How to write Badass READMES for your Github projects</title>

      <guid>https://www.stefannibrasil.me/posts/github-readme-examples-and-template/</guid>
      <description>You show your GitHub project to people but they don&amp;rsquo;t understand what the code is about. Why should you take time to write a good README if they can simply &amp;ldquo;read the code&amp;rdquo;?
They won&amp;rsquo;t even look at your code if you don&amp;rsquo;t explain what&amp;rsquo;s in it for them. Why should anyone care about it?
What about making them curious about your project? It saves them time, it shows you care about good communication and that by writing good docs you probably write good code as well.</description>

      <description>Let&amp;rsquo;s say you&amp;rsquo;re learning how to paint. When you look at the famous paintings at the museum, you might start asking yourself:
&amp;ldquo;Will I ever be this good? Is this for me? Will I ever get to paint something like this?&amp;rdquo;
If these questions sound familiar, it&amp;rsquo;s because you&amp;rsquo;re not alone. It&amp;rsquo;s not just you.
The same questions can be applied to coding. Some things, like painting and learning how to code, are hard.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;Why is it so difficult to find Junior Ruby on Rails dev roles?&amp;quot;
You have finished multiple online courses, workshops and might even read some books to learn Ruby. You start job hunting and you struggle to land a position because of your lack of experience.
So how do you get experience with large Ruby and Rails apps when no one wants to hire early-career devs?
It&amp;rsquo;s a tough market for any early-career dev with little to no experience, so it&amp;rsquo;s no different with Ruby.</description>

      <description>In the last Open Source Thursdays live, Thiago and I shared how we chose a few issues that looked promising for us.
By the end of the post, you&amp;rsquo;ll learn how to filter issues, and how to start contributing to Rails by reproducing a bug.
How to choose your first Ruby on Rails issue Which one from the +300 open issues should you pick? We tried breaking this process down into 2 parts: filtering them by labels, then choosing one that seems easier to fix.</description>

      <description>What is Open Source Thursdays? Open Source Thursdays is a new project from the hexdevs team, aka me and Thiago.
We started this project because we&amp;rsquo;ve always wanted to contribute to rails! So we thought, why not do it live so more people can join us? Our goal is to make open source contributions more popular.
Neither of us has done this before. The plan is to get there and do everything live, no preparing in advance.</description>

      <description>Ruby is keeping you interested in transitioning to the software development world. But you&amp;rsquo;re not sure you&amp;rsquo;re gonna be employable. You might have heard that you should just choose JavaScript because, you know, everyone is saying Ruby is a dying domain.
But you don&amp;rsquo;t see yourself keeping up with the Kardashians traditional JS web dev world.
You&amp;rsquo;ve heard that there are plenty of Ruby/Rails jobs out there. But how do you get your first one as an early career dev?</description>

The reason why it&amp;rsquo;s lighter is because Rails API-only won&amp;rsquo;t render HTML pages, handle user sessions &amp;amp; cookies, nor display any assets.</description>

      <description>Which authentication strategy should you use for Rails API? How to implement a secure authentication strategy is by the far the most confusing part of building an API.
