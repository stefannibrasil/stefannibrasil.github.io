Check out the Ruby meetup calendar or this list of upcoming Ruby conferences; Choose one active person in that community. Tip: look for people who give talks regularly or are mentors. Or even someone who had a similar journey as you; Send them a message asking for their advice/insights about the ruby/Rails market for junior devs.  If you don’t know what to send, here’s a template that you can use: “Hi! I’ve been practicing Ruby and I found you from this community! I hope you don’t mind reaching out. I’d like to ask you what are the companies you\u0026rsquo;d recommend junior Ruby devs applying for? Do you have any advice on how I can improve my portfolio?”.\nAsking specific questions like these shows that you did your research, and helps people understand how they can help you. It\u0026rsquo;s great to meet more experienced devs and potentially create a mentorship relationship.\nBy reaching out to someone from the Ruby community you will see opportunities you never thought of before.

How to implement a secure authentication strategy is by the far the most confusing part of building an API.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s important to evaluate your app requirements before choosing any strategy in the first place to avoid any security implications.\nTo help you figure out which authentication strategy is the best for your case, here are 5 possible solutions for you:\nRails API-only If your API is running as a standalone app and you don\u0026rsquo;t need a web interface of any sort, then a header-based token auth might be enough.\n1. jwt-ruby If you\u0026rsquo;re looking for a simple and secure token-based authentication auth strategy, you can use this gem to generate the JWT (JSON Web Token) to send on your Authentication Request Header.\nPros It provides an out of the box JWT token strategy mechanism.\nCons You need to implement the token verification on the server-side. You can use Rails HTTP authentication support for that.\n2. api_guard Is a token based authentication solution with token refreshing \u0026amp; allowlisting for APIs built on Rails.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s built on top of jwt-ruby, so besides all the JWT functionalities, you also get account creation and authentication features.\nPros It\u0026rsquo;s a clean and simple solution. It can be used with Devise, if needed.\nCons You might not even need a gem, because most of it is honestly not that hard to implement yourself. It\u0026rsquo;s an overhead if you don\u0026rsquo;t need to expire tokens.\nStandard Rails app with API If you need some sort of account management interface for your API, or to implement oauth or omniauth flows, here are some alternatives:\n3. Doorkeeper It\u0026rsquo;s a flexible OAuth 2 provider functionality to your Rails or Grape app.\nPros It provides all oauth flows. Can be used with Devise. Version \u0026gt; supports Rails API-only mode as well.\nCons Don\u0026rsquo;t use it if you don\u0026rsquo;t need an oauth2 flow.\n4. devise_token_auth Use it if your Rails app already uses Devise and you want to add a token-based auth for your API. You can require endpoints to have an authenticated user or not depending on the needs of your API.\nPros If you\u0026rsquo;re happy with Devise and already use it on your Rails app, it\u0026rsquo;s the easiest solution. It also makes it easy to add omniauth provider functionality.\nCons Devise is also well know for bloating your Rails app, so keep this in mind. \u0026gt;= Currently supports Rails version ≥ 4.2.0.\n5. rodauth-rails Rodauth-rails is built on top of Rodauth, which is an authentication framework alternative to Devise.\nPros Rodauth supports JWT, including refresh tokens functionality. Supports Rails API-only mode.\nCons If you need social logins or omniauth providers, you\u0026rsquo;ll need to implement yourself but you can build one yourself using the existing Rodauth API.\nAPI authentication can be super confusing. I hope you got some ideas on how to move forward with choosing the strategy that best suit your API requirements. Taking some time to evalute the best strategy earlier can save you lots of time and work.\n If you found this post helpful, sign up to get more content like this in your inbox! :)\n ","permalink":"https://www.stefannibrasil.me/posts/5-ways-to-handle-your-rails-api-authentication/","summary":"Which authentication strategy should you use for Rails API?

I could have, but I didn’t want to spend money on it. Not super clever, I know.\nLooking back, I get mad at myself for putting savings before my mental health needs. This experience changed me, since it took me less than one year to improve my mental health, live a happier and confident life. It was a big growth moment.\nMoney now has a different meaning to me. I don\u0026rsquo;t go out there spending like crazy but I also don\u0026rsquo;t track every expense. What is more important to me now is think of as an investment. Instead of fixating too much on how much I can save, I decided to think og how much I can create.\n“Wait, are you telling me to ignore cutting down my expenses and do everything that\u0026rsquo;s important to me, then?”\nNot exactly.\nBefore investing in my Mental Health, I didn’t know what I wanted to do with my life.\nSaving money was my priority. I’m proud of committing to it. Good or not, it allowed me to having the option to quit my job during a pandemic. Plus, I know I can achieve any goals I set myself to, which is awesome.\nThe danger lies in seeing everything as equally important.\nWhen we don’t get clarity on what matters to us, we end up doing what everyone else is doing. That\u0026rsquo;s the danger of not knowing where you\u0026rsquo;re money is going. Saving more right now might be what you need to create the space to reflect on your life. but only you can know that.\nOne way to balance your present and future happiness What if you start by deciding with what is the most important to you?\nHere\u0026rsquo;s an exercise from the book Not Meditating - Finding Peace, Love and Happiness without sitting still:\n Imagine someone is reading the eulogy at your funeral. What would you want them to say about your relationships, your attitude to life, your achievements? Would you want to be described as positive, fun-loving, and caring? Would you want your family and friends to say you always had time for them? Would you want to describe how you followed your dreams and made the most of your life? Would you want them to describe you always had the latest car or TV or to mention your recent promotion or pay rise? Would you want them to say, “Well they were always very busy\u0026quot;?\n Start designing your today for the life you want to be remembered for.

I saw lots of junior opportunities at Rails Conf, for example. if you\u0026rsquo;re an experienced dev wanting to work on more complex problems using a sophisticated tool, absolutely yes.  The question then becomes \u0026ldquo;what kind of opportunities are there for Rails devs in 2021?\u0026quot;.\nIs there still a market for Ruby on Rails? The reason why Rails seems to be \u0026lsquo;paused\u0026rsquo; is because there are not lots of things to keep improving it. You can see this as a good thing, though: it\u0026rsquo;s a stable framework!\nRails is a proven, well-understood, and stable web dev standard. That\u0026rsquo;s what makes it popular.\nThat means learning Rails can give you the opportunities to work with:\n  Existing established companies that won\u0026rsquo;t throw away their Rails code.

Decide. What kills overconfidence is overthinking. Keep deciding, as if your life depends on it. If it helps, write down the consequences of your decision, and think through it with a rational perspective. What do you have to lose? Is probably less than you think. Fail fast. Learn. Keep trying. This process builds thicker skin. You’ll get more confident by trying, not from getting perfect on the first try. Perfection is the killer of great things. Take risks. Afraid of failing? So what! Do it either way. Confidence-boost is a habit. Risk keeps you on life’s edge. It keeps you growing, inspiring, and gaining confidence. Turn your fear into an ally. Fear is a powerful feeling. Instead of letting it stop you, can you imagine using that force to get you moving towards what you want? Break your big goals into small actionable goals. When facing big challenges, battle feelings of being overwhelmed by breaking them down. Something as simple as writing down a to-do list works. Practice self-compassion. When things don’t go as you expected, it’s the perfect moment to practice self-compassion. The central precept of self-compassion is that we should all be kinder to ourselves because doing so makes us healthier, more fulfilled, and more successful in the pursuits we choose. Name your inner negative voices. I started naming my negative voices: Judge Judy, Pam Planner. This helps me handle my cognitive distortions better. Once I identify who my voices are, I can say “thanks, Pam, but we’ll be fine!”. By the way, if your name is Judy or Pam, feel free to use my name for your voices :P. Start a Thought Record Journal. When you get yourself too overwhelmed by your cognitive distortions, add them to a Thought Record. Why does it work? It shows you that your thoughts are way less powerful than you think at first. Making them ‘real’ gives you an analytical perspective of the situation, and you realize it’s not that a big deal. Try it next time. Here’s a template to help you get started.  Somedays I have to practice them TWICE. But it gets easier every time 🏋️‍♀️.\nWhy does my brain try to sabotage me? 🧠 Nerdy as I am, I needed to understand why my brain was my biggest enemy.\nWell, it turns out it’s because our brain hasn’t evolved as we imagine.\nIt still thinks we live in the wild, and it’s trying to save us from predators. So I learned that my brain was just excessively trying to protect me. There’s danger in doing different things.\nSince our predators have changed, this protection is not well suited for our modern society anymore. If not recognized, our fear of getting out of our comfort zone can stop us from achieving great things.\nNow that you’ve got this information, every time you get yourself doubting yourself, take it as an opportunity to be grateful for recognizing this moment and say:\n Thanks, my primitive brain, for your concern, but I got this 💪\n Resources The Confidence Code: The Science and Art of Self-Assurance - What women should know*\nRadical Acceptance: Awakening the Love That Heals Fear and Shame\nFeeling Good: The New Mood Therapy\nCognitive Behavioral Therapy\nHow to practice Mindfulness\n*I strongly recommend it to anyone interested in understanding why women suffer more from lack of confidence, and how everyone can help solving this issue.\nIf you found this post helpful, follow me on Twitter and send me your thoughts :)\n","permalink":"https://www.stefannibrasil.me/posts/how-to-practice-self-confidence/","summary":"I believed I had to had born confident.
