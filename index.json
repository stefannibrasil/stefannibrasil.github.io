[{"content":"Hello, I‚Äôm Stefanni Brasil. Thanks for visiting my page!\nAbout me As a self-taught developer, I struggled a lot in the past with anxiety and a lack of confidence in myself.\nI used to compare myself a lot, feel stressed all day when lots of bugs were being reported.\nAfter eating a plant-based diet since the end of 2019, I asked myself how I was so happy in being kind to animals and the planet but so miserable being hard on myself.\nIn 2020 I decided to ask for professional help and I started doing Therapy sessions with a Cognitive Behaviour Therapy specialist.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s when the new Stefanni was born! I am now a more confident person, and I try to live by the mission of being kind to all living beings.\nCurrent projects I have saved enough money to cover my expenses for about 2 years, so I am not looking for job opportunities at this moment.\nMy professional goal now is to build a product my audience needs and are happy paying for it.\nOne of my side projects is the hexdevs podcast, the podcast for the curious developer.\nI record a series there called Dev to Founder, where I share my journey progress every 2 weeks.\nOn the creative side, I am learning digital lettering with Procreate.\nAnd sending emails to my plant-based diet exclusive email list every 2 weeks.\nGet in touch If you have something interesting to share, send me an email at stefanni at hexdevs dot com.\n","permalink":"https://www.stefannibrasil.me/about/","summary":"About Stefanni Brasil - The Kind Developer","title":"Start here ‚≠ê"},{"content":"I believed I had to had born confident.

Decide. What kills overconfidence is overthinking. Keep deciding, as if your life depends on it. If it helps, write down the consequences of your decision, and think through it with a rational perspective. What do you have to lose? Is probably less than you think. Fail fast. Learn. Keep trying. This process builds thicker skin. You\u0026rsquo;ll get more confident by trying, not from getting perfect on the first try. Perfection is the killer of great things. Take risks. Afraid of failing? So what! Do it either way. Confidence-boost is a habit. Risk keeps you on life\u0026rsquo;s edge. It keeps you growing, inspiring, and gaining confidence. Turn your fear into an ally. Fear is a powerful feeling. Instead of letting it stop you, can you imagine using that force to get you moving towards what you want? Break your big goals into small actionable goals. When facing big challenges, battle feelings of being overwhelmed by breaking them down. Something as simple as writing down a to-do list works. Fake it until you make it. It\u0026rsquo;s a way to simply take action. Live today as if all you ever wanted is already yours. Do one small thing, and then the next will be easier, and more confidence will flow. When you fail, accept yourself and your humanity. When things don\u0026rsquo;t go as you expected, it\u0026rsquo;s the perfect moment to practice self-compassion. The central precept of self-compassion is that we should all be kinder to ourselves because doing so makes us healthier, more fulfilled, and more successful in the pursuits we choose. Name your inner negative voices. I started naming my negative voices: Judge Judy, Pam Planner. This helps me handle my cognitive distortions better. By the way, if your name is Judy or Pam, feel free to use my name for your voices :P. Start a Thought Record Journal. When you get yourself too overwhelmed by your cognitive distortions, add them to a Thought Record. Why does it work? It shows you that your thoughts are way less powerful than you think at first, and they might convince you everything is lost. Making them \u0026lsquo;real\u0026rsquo; gives you an analytical perspective of the situation, and you realize it\u0026rsquo;s not that a big deal. Try it next time.  If you\u0026rsquo;re interested in having your Thought Record Journal, I sell a pack of a template and real examples to get you started. The examples are from my own experience.\nI am not saying any of these is easy. Somedays I have to practice them TWICE. But it gets easier every time üèãÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è.\nWhy does my brain try to sabotage me? üß† Nerdy as I am, I needed to understand why my brain was my biggest enemy.\nWell, our brain hasn\u0026rsquo;t evolved as fast as we imagine.\nIt still thinks we live in the wild, and it\u0026rsquo;s desperately trying to save us from predators.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s why staying where you are is so comforting. There\u0026rsquo;s danger in doing different things.\nNow that you\u0026rsquo;ve got this information, every time you get yourself doubting yourself, take it as an opportunity to be grateful for recognizing this moment and say:\n Thanks, my primitive brain, for your concern, but I got this üí™\n Resources The Confidence Code: The Science and Art of Self-Assurance - What women should know*\nRadical Acceptance: Awakening the Love That Heals Fear and Shame\nFeeling Good: The New Mood Therapy\nCognitive Behavioral Therapy\nHow to practice Mindfulness\n*I strongly recommend it to anyone interested in understanding why women suffer more from lack of confidence, and how everyone can help solving this issue.\n","permalink":"https://www.stefannibrasil.me/posts/how-to-practice-self-confidence/","summary":"I believed I had to had born confident.
