Is this for me? Will I ever understand all of this?\u0026rdquo;\nIf these questions sound familiar, it\u0026rsquo;s because you\u0026rsquo;re not alone. It\u0026rsquo;s not just you.\nBelieve it or not, the same questions can be applied to coding. Some things, like painting and learning how to code, are hard. Transitioning into tech is hard.\nIn case you need a boost of inspiration and to be reminded that it\u0026rsquo;s possible to make it happen, here\u0026rsquo;s a list of a few successful Rails developers that come from unusual backgrounds.\nEileen Utchichetlle How many photographers do you know that have turned out to be developers? Eileen is one of them! She has a BFA in Photography and she worked on magazine layout, email marketing, as well as editing as a Production Designer for 2 years before she decided to change her career.\nShe\u0026rsquo;s now a Principal Software Engineer at GitHub. She\u0026rsquo;s also a member of the Rails Core Team and the Rails Security Team.\nEileen has given lots of talks and keynotes, despite being afraid of public speaking!\nLovisa Svallingson (in memoriam) This is how Lovisa described her skills:\n\u0026ldquo;With a background in languages, working with people, and various creative endeavors, I bring a unique and well-rounded perspective to the work I do\u0026rdquo;.\nLovisa\u0026rsquo;s background was in languages and she was an English teacher. Later on, she attended the Turing School of Software and Design.\nLovisa passed away and I want to dedicate this post in her honor. She was a Bootcamp graduate\u0026rsquo;s Advocate and she wanted to help more people who are transitioning into tech, just like you.\nMay her time here on Earth be an example that your diverse background is your strength.\nDr. Barbara Oakley Note: cheating a bit here because Dr. Oakley is not a Rails developer but consider this a bonus material :)\nDr. Barbara has a B.A. in Slavic Languages and Literature. Later on, she decided to study Engineering.\nShe has written lots of books about how to learn effectively, all backed up by Neuroscience. She is the creator of the most famous MOOC free course called Learning how to Learn.\nShe\u0026rsquo;s an advocate of having multiple backgrounds as it can give you more insights on your new journey.\nChanging careers signals that you\u0026rsquo;re constantly learning new things! It\u0026rsquo;s an example that learning is part of your lifestyle. You\u0026rsquo;re being mentally flexible.\n What do they all have in common? It took them years to get where they are today. But they all started somewhere and they embraced their diversity. I\u0026rsquo;m pretty sure they once felt the same as you.\nTake a deep breath now. Can you imagine all the great things you will accomplish after you become a developer? The world is big enough for your ambitions, keep going!\nIf you still need some extra inspiration, I highly recommend you watching this amazing Ted Talk from Amy Cuddy called Your body language may shape who you are. Go check it out.\nI hope you\u0026rsquo;re feeling a bit more relaxed and inspired!

You start job hunting and you struggle to land a position because of your lack of experience.\nSo how do you get experience with large Ruby and Rails apps when no one wants to hire early-career devs?\nIt\u0026rsquo;s a tough market for any early-career dev with little to no experience, so it\u0026rsquo;s no different with Ruby. You\u0026rsquo;re not alone, my friend!\nIf you don\u0026rsquo;t know what else you can do besides doing another tutorial or starting another small Ruby project, here\u0026rsquo;s an idea for you: contribute to Rails.\n\u0026ldquo;Wait, what? Me? Contribute to Rails? I\u0026rsquo;m just starting my career!\u0026rdquo;\nI know. This is not usually recommended as a beginner-friendly open source project but here\u0026rsquo;s something you probably haven\u0026rsquo;t thought about yet.\nWhat if you learned Ruby on Rails from the source? Now that you have done tiny apps it\u0026rsquo;s time to try something different.\nRails can be daunting. It\u0026rsquo;s so abstract and complex. I feel the same!\nHowever, just by lurking around you\u0026rsquo;ll see how a large project is designed and maintained.\nThis might not seem like it\u0026rsquo;s important but you\u0026rsquo;ll be learning how to:\n read other people\u0026rsquo;s code; read documentation; write good documentation, commits, and Pull Requests; navigate in a large codebase; ask for and do code reviews; improve your communication skills (super important for remote jobs);  Believe it not, these things are what you\u0026rsquo;ll be doing most of the time as a developer.\nYou will have a better understanding of the tool you\u0026rsquo;re using every day. Can you imagine how cool it can be to use those skills on your projects? Interesting topics to discuss on interviews, huh?\nHow does this approach help me get a job? Although this won\u0026rsquo;t guarantee you\u0026rsquo;ll land a job soon, it certainly will help you develop competitive advantages. A few examples:\n Apply your lessons on your projects (great for your portfolio!); Write blog posts or present a talk teaching others how to understand a specific module; You will feel like a badass! Plus, it\u0026rsquo;s a way to show you have good initiative; Some companies allow skipping the whiteboard interview if you have interesting open-source contributions; You\u0026rsquo;ll be connected with more experienced/expert Ruby devs; You\u0026rsquo;ll be putting yourself out there instead of just learning on your own.  But first, you need to get started.\nHow to get started with contributing to Rails Go to the Rails GitHub repository. Choose one module. ActionPack, for example, is a good option because it doesn\u0026rsquo;t require any database drivers configuration.\nChoose one merged Pull Request (suggestions: this or this one) to get started. You probably won\u0026rsquo;t understand either of the PRs. Don\u0026rsquo;t panic, that\u0026rsquo;s expected! Keep reading.\nWhen you take a look at the PRs, you\u0026rsquo;re not expected to understand the changes. The goal is to ask yourself: Why were the changes were made? How did the author approach it? How was the code review given? Was the author a regular contributor? Did the issue have reproducible steps?\nWhat can you learn from it? Nothing is a valid answer although I\u0026rsquo;m pretty sure you at least learned that it\u0026rsquo;s not beginner-friendly. That\u0026rsquo;s something, right?\nYou can even go one step further: could you learn a thing or two about Ruby? Is it touching the controllers, the models, the views? What is the context?\nRinse and repeat until you feel like you\u0026rsquo;re starting to understand how things are done on the project. It\u0026rsquo;s going to take some time.\nEventually, you\u0026rsquo;ll feel more confident to work on an issue. However, when you go through the Rails documentation, you\u0026rsquo;ll know this is just one of many ways to contribute to the project 😉.\nBut Rails is scary! What if I get stuck all the time? It\u0026rsquo;s going to be difficult. Remember: Rails is super hard. But the goal is not to aim to understand it for now. The goal is to get familiar with large codebases, seeing how people ask questions, give code reviews, reading the docs.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s also normal on the day-to-day of a developer. It\u0026rsquo;s a good opportunity to practice asking good questions and learn how to get unstuck. These are valuable skills for your career.\nGive it a try. Set an event on your calendar to do this for at least 1 hour every week. Write down your progress, celebrate every tiny lesson, and see what happens.\n ","permalink":"https://www.stefannibrasil.me/posts/tech-job-hunt-with-no-experience/","summary":"\u0026ldquo;Why is it so difficult to find Junior Ruby on Rails dev roles?\u0026quot;\nYou have finished multiple online courses, workshops and might even read some books to learn Ruby.

Implicit to Explicit: Decoding Ruby\u0026rsquo;s Magical Syntax by Justin Gordon [Talk] Do you wish you could understand better what Rails does under the hood? This talk is a great reference for anyone starting with Ruby and Rails. Bonus: learn some Pry Debugger tips to help you demystify any Ruby code.\nSlides can be found here.\n2 Believe in the Rails Magic: Unlock the Power of Rails by Learn Academy Do you want to learn more about how does the MVC pattern work? Then this one if for you. You\u0026rsquo;ll create a simple CRUD app with a step by step guide on what which command is doing. You\u0026rsquo;ll learn how does the routes, controllers, views and models interact with each other.\nGithub repository can be found here and the slides here.\n3. Intro to Test Driven Development: How to Safely Make Changes by Zack Pieper [Workshop] Capybara? Rspec? Mini Test? What is the difference between them? Is the syntax making you feel confused?\nThen definitely follow along with this workshop. It\u0026rsquo;s a nice introduction to TDD and Rails testing in general.\nResources to follow along can be found here.\n4. Hotwire: HTML over the wire by Noel Rappin [Workshop] For Rails beginners, Hotwire is great because you can focus on improving your Rails skills without worrying too much about front end yet. For experienced Rails devs, Hotwire will make you feel less depressed about front-end.\nIn this workshop, you get to practice Hotwire by adding realtime frontend changes to a Rails app. You can find the code to follow along here.\nFor more on Hotwire, you might also want to check out Hotwire Demystified by Jamie Gaskins. This talk breaks down Hotwire basics, as well as the tradeoffs between SPAs and Hotwire.\n5. OAuth 2.0 Deconstructed by Peter Jang Did you ever wanted to understand OAuth better? Looking at the charts showing you all the callbacks and tokens going back and forward doesn\u0026rsquo;t help that much.\nThis workshop is a nice intro to OAuth behind the scenes. You will implement OAuth from scratch for several providers (Shopify and GitHub) on a Sinatra app.\nGithub repo to follow along can be found here.\n6. How to be a great developer without being a great coder by Nicole Carpenter [Talk] This is a nice talk to watch when you need to be reminded that being a great developer is more than just mastering technical skills.\nThere are no resources for this one, so just watch it and get a boost of motivation.\n7. All the Things I Thought I Couldn\u0026rsquo;t Do by Eileen Uchitelle [Keynote] Watch this one whenever you need to get some motivation. Eileen was a photographer and she is now a Rails core maintainer. This is a kind reminder that everyone starts somewhere!\n These are the top 5 Rails conf 2021 talks that stood out to me.

We tried breaking this process down into 2 parts: filtering them by labels, then choosing one that seems easier to fix.\nWe went through the open issues and here\u0026rsquo;s what we found:\n There are no open issues labeled good first issue, so you have to search for some good ones; Most of the open issues are labeled as stale.

When we saw the gist with the steps to reproduce the issue we didn\u0026rsquo;t know how to run it! We learned that you can run a Rails app that is just a single ruby file by using the bundler/inline feature.

You aren\u0026rsquo;t alone.\nWe all have heard that there are tons of tech jobs in the market but there aren\u0026rsquo;t qualified professionals to fulfill them. So you go and spend days doing online courses and getting certifications so you can join the wave. Doing this is great to get started but they can only help you at a certain point.\nAlright, what else can I do? How do I get experience if no one is willing to give me an opportunity to even get started? Sorry to bring bad realistic news, but no one will give you an opportunity. You have to create yours.\nJust practicing your coding skills isn\u0026rsquo;t enough When I was learning how to code a few years ago, I would \u0026lsquo;practice\u0026rsquo; my coding skills by following online tutorials and creating tiny apps. This was a great way to get started but eventually, I reached a limit. I needed to get real experience, otherwise, I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t get out of the tuto hell world.\nI knew I didn\u0026rsquo;t have any experience to apply for jobs, so I had to try something else. I went to local meetups, I gave talks, I attended 2-days workshops until one day I applied to be a coach in one of them. Besides that, I also shared my journey and coding studies on my blog.\nBecause I was putting myself out there and I had great communication skills, I landed my first internship. There are no guarantees this works 100% of the time but it creates more opportunities than just do another course.\nLanding this internship wasn\u0026rsquo;t easy and I almost gave up because I couldn\u0026rsquo;t finish the coding challenge! I was so focused on what I lacked that I couldn\u0026rsquo;t see what I had to contribute.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s easy to focus too much on technical skills and forget about the other skills that make you a better professional. Yes, you will be coding on a computer but your work will be designed, reviewed evaluated, and used by humans.\nCan you see the difference between \u0026ldquo;keep practicing\u0026rdquo; and actively creating your opportunities?\nYou don\u0026rsquo;t need to know everything. No one does. You learn by actively putting yourself out there, and not by doing another workshop, especially when you already have done several of them.\nSchools and colleges are living proofs that \u0026lsquo;learning\u0026rsquo; in a controlled environment doesn\u0026rsquo;t guarantee you\u0026rsquo;ll know how to solve problems when you\u0026rsquo;re out there in the real world.\nYou don\u0026rsquo;t need to get a dev job to get experience After you understand and apply the basic concepts of programming, the fastest you grasp opportunities to immerse yourself in real-world projects and working with others, the faster you\u0026rsquo;ll advance your coding skills.\nWhenever you spot one of these, do it without hesitating (unless, of course, it\u0026rsquo;s an unpaid internship by a company making lots of money).\nIt doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter if it\u0026rsquo;s an internship, open-source contributions, or solving a problem for a friend/family member as a freelancer professional. Important to mention that even landing an internship is also competitive but it might lead to a full-time job offer.\nBy applying what you\u0026rsquo;ve learned in a direct approach like this you\u0026rsquo;ll know what you don\u0026rsquo;t know. It\u0026rsquo;s way better than learning every best way to implement this Rails or that React feature. Do it, learn, keep doing this.\nIf you decide to keep practicing on your own (aka, continue doing what you\u0026rsquo;re doing) you already know the results. It\u0026rsquo;s like always working out the same muscle with the same weights at the gym: it\u0026rsquo;s cozy, it feels like progress and everything will stay the same. It also means you can\u0026rsquo;t complain about the outputs if the inputs are always the same.\nOh, and next time you\u0026rsquo;re convinced you should wait until you have learned x, y or z to apply for jobs, try this: put a white male U.S. senator cape, leap through the doubt and show up. Thanks, Leslie Knope.\nWhat do you have to lose? You\u0026rsquo;ve already done something brave: you changed your career, and learned how to code! Keep challenging yourself.

By the end of this post, you\u0026rsquo;ll feel less intimated to contribute to rails today (if you want).\nOpen source onboarding for the rest of us Eileen Uchitelle, from the Rails Core Team Member, mentioned on her railsconf keynote how she got started. She did lots of pair programming with experienced rails contributors.\nBut, you probably don\u0026rsquo;t work for Shopify or Github. At least, I don\u0026rsquo;t.\nThat got me thinking\u0026hellip; what if I don\u0026rsquo;t have to do it by myself?\nSo I recruited Thiago, my partner in crime to do it with me. We tried to make good use of the hexdevs YouTube channel to share our contribution to rails live.\nTo our surprise, Gabi Stefanini, Engineering Team Lead at Shopify, and Rafael Franca (Rails core contributor, also from Shopify) joined us!\nWe didn\u0026rsquo;t expect anyone to show up to be honest, but having them there made us feel less intimated. We also learned a lot doing this chat remote onboarding with them:\n Not sure how to know if you set up rails successfully? Running the test suites means you\u0026rsquo;re good to go 🎉 You don\u0026rsquo;t actually need to set up the entire rails project to get started. You can choose one module. We went with ActionPack because it doesn\u0026rsquo;t require any database drivers. After forking and cloning the project, go to the module you want to get started and run the tests to verify the setup (cd activepack then rake tests). Hint: if you get an error, run bundle exec rake test. Contributing to Open Source goes beyond writing code. Reproducing issues or testing patches, translating the guides are all great ways to get started and make a difference with your work. If you found something confusing or missing, why not turn it into a better experience for the next person? Chances are you\u0026rsquo;re not the only one. Keeping the documentation up to date and clear to whoever joins after you is super important to make other beginners get involved. Open source etiquette is learned by\u0026hellip; making contributions. A great way to get started is to look at previous commits and Pull requests. I wasn\u0026rsquo;t sure how to name my branch, my commits, or even my Pull Request but Thiago suggested looking at the previous ones to get an idea. I was super nervous but having someone there was very comforting! The rails documentation is great! Kudos to whoever put effort and time into creating it! Nothing beats the developer experience of having great documentation. Having your first PR merged live was a hell of a surprise!  Your Homework: contribute to rails today Go to the rails project on github. Fork it, then clone it. Take a look at the modules there and choose one to get started by making sure you can run its test suite.\nGo through the documentation and see if you can find something that needs to be updated, or translated. Could you try reproducing a bug? Fixing a patch?\nLet me know what you end up doing! Start small but start today. You\u0026rsquo;ll never know how much you\u0026rsquo;ll learn from this experience 🙂\nIf you found this post useful and want to get involved with contributing to rails with us, you\u0026rsquo;re super invited to join us next time!

How to implement a secure authentication strategy is by the far the most confusing part of building an API.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s important to evaluate your app requirements before choosing any strategy in the first place to avoid any security implications.\nTo help you figure out which authentication strategy is the best for your case, here are 5 possible solutions for you:\nRails API-only If your API is running as a standalone app and you don\u0026rsquo;t need a web interface of any sort, then a header-based token auth might be enough.\n1. jwt-ruby If you\u0026rsquo;re looking for a simple and secure token-based authentication auth strategy, you can use this gem to generate the JWT (JSON Web Token) to send on your Authentication Request Header.\nPros It provides an out of the box JWT token strategy mechanism.\nCons You need to implement the token verification on the server-side. You can use Rails HTTP authentication support for that.\n2. api_guard Is a token based authentication solution with token refreshing \u0026amp; allowlisting for APIs built on Rails.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s built on top of jwt-ruby, so besides all the JWT functionalities, you also get account creation and authentication features.\nPros It\u0026rsquo;s a clean and simple solution. It can be used with Devise, if needed.\nCons You might not even need a gem, because most of it is honestly not that hard to implement yourself. It\u0026rsquo;s an overhead if you don\u0026rsquo;t need to expire tokens.\nStandard Rails app with API If you need some sort of account management interface for your API, or to implement oauth or omniauth flows, here are some alternatives:\n3. Doorkeeper It\u0026rsquo;s a flexible OAuth 2 provider functionality to your Rails or Grape app.\nPros It provides all oauth flows. Can be used with Devise. Version \u0026gt; supports Rails API-only mode as well.\nCons Don\u0026rsquo;t use it if you don\u0026rsquo;t need an oauth2 flow.\n4. devise_token_auth Use it if your Rails app already uses Devise and you want to add a token-based auth for your API. You can require endpoints to have an authenticated user or not depending on the needs of your API.\nPros If you\u0026rsquo;re happy with Devise and already use it on your Rails app, it\u0026rsquo;s the easiest solution. It also makes it easy to add omniauth provider functionality.\nCons Devise is also well know for bloating your Rails app, so keep this in mind. \u0026gt;= Currently supports Rails version ≥ 4.2.0.\n5. rodauth-rails Rodauth-rails is built on top of Rodauth, which is an authentication framework alternative to Devise.\nPros Rodauth supports JWT, including refresh tokens functionality. Supports Rails API-only mode.\nCons If you need social logins or omniauth providers, you\u0026rsquo;ll need to implement yourself but you can build one yourself using the existing Rodauth API.\nAPI authentication can be super confusing. I hope you got some ideas on how to move forward with choosing the strategy that best suit your API requirements. Taking some time to evalute the best strategy earlier can save you lots of time and work.\n ","permalink":"https://www.stefannibrasil.me/posts/5-ways-to-handle-your-rails-api-authentication/","summary":"Which authentication strategy should you use for Rails API?

I could have, but I didn’t want to spend money on it. Not super clever, I know.\nLooking back, I get mad at myself for putting savings before my mental health needs. This experience changed me, since it took me less than one year to improve my mental health, live a happier and confident life. It was a big growth moment.\nMoney now has a different meaning to me. I don\u0026rsquo;t go out there spending like crazy but I also don\u0026rsquo;t track every expense. What is more important to me now is think of as an investment. Instead of fixating too much on how much I can save, I decided to think og how much I can create.\n“Wait, are you telling me to ignore cutting down my expenses and do everything that\u0026rsquo;s important to me, then?”\nNot exactly.\nBefore investing in my Mental Health, I didn’t know what I wanted to do with my life.\nSaving money was my priority. I’m proud of committing to it. Good or not, it allowed me to having the option to quit my job during a pandemic. Plus, I know I can achieve any goals I set myself to, which is awesome.\nThe danger lies in seeing everything as equally important.\nWhen we don’t get clarity on what matters to us, we end up doing what everyone else is doing. That\u0026rsquo;s the danger of not knowing where you\u0026rsquo;re money is going. Saving more right now might be what you need to create the space to reflect on your life. but only you can know that.\nOne way to balance your present and future happiness What if you start by deciding with what is the most important to you?\nHere\u0026rsquo;s an exercise from the book Not Meditating - Finding Peace, Love and Happiness without sitting still:\n Imagine someone is reading the eulogy at your funeral. What would you want them to say about your relationships, your attitude to life, your achievements? Would you want to be described as positive, fun-loving, and caring? Would you want your family and friends to say you always had time for them? Would you want to describe how you followed your dreams and made the most of your life? Would you want them to describe you always had the latest car or TV or to mention your recent promotion or pay rise? Would you want them to say, “Well they were always very busy\u0026quot;?\n Start designing your today for the life you want to be remembered for. Once you get clear on what matters to you, it\u0026rsquo;s easier to say no to all the rest.\n If you’ve enjoyed this content, you might want to check out Spark your Runway with FIRE.

Or even Javascript?\u0026rdquo; If you\u0026rsquo;ve been asking yourself these questions, this post is for you.\nWhen I was learning how to code in 2016, Ruby on Rails was trending and every startup was using it. It was obvious that learning Rails would be an easy way to get my first dev job. We\u0026rsquo;re in 2021, though, and things have changed.\nThe answer to \u0026ldquo;Is Rails still relevant?\u0026rdquo; depends on your context:\n if you\u0026rsquo;re looking for your first dev job, it depends on how fast you need one. Python and JavaScript seem to have more opportunities for early-career devs. It\u0026rsquo;s not as if there aren\u0026rsquo;t any junior Rails devs jobs! I saw lots of junior opportunities at Rails Conf, for example. if you\u0026rsquo;re an experienced dev wanting to work on more complex problems using a sophisticated tool, absolutely yes. I\u0026rsquo;ve also heard several times that Ruby jobs are the ones who pay more.  The question then becomes \u0026ldquo;what kind of opportunities are there for Rails devs in 2021?\u0026quot;.\nIs there still a market for Ruby on Rails? The reason why Rails seems to be \u0026lsquo;paused\u0026rsquo; is because there are not lots of things to keep improving it. You can see this as a good thing, though: it\u0026rsquo;s a stable framework!\nRails is a proven, well-understood, and stable web dev standard. That\u0026rsquo;s what makes it popular.\nThat means learning Rails can give you the opportunities to work with:\n  Existing established companies that won\u0026rsquo;t throw away their Rails code. A few examples: Github, Shopify, Vimeo, Clio;\n  Small businesses that don\u0026rsquo;t care which tech stack you build their products;\n  Early-stage companies adopting Rails. A few examples: circle.so, orbit.love, meetcleo.com.\n  So if any of these markets look like what you\u0026rsquo;d be happy working with, then you can invest your time learning Rails without worrying there aren\u0026rsquo;t gonna have jobs for you.\n If you\u0026rsquo;d also like to know the opinion from experienced Rails dev besides my own, you might be interested in checking out the replies for this question on Twitter:\nExperienced Rails devs:\nWhat would you say to an entry-level dev who asked you if it\u0026#39;s a good idea for them to learn Ruby/Rails?\n\u0026mdash; Stefanni Brasil (@stefannibrasil) May 4, 2021   ","permalink":"https://www.stefannibrasil.me/posts/is-ruby-on-rails-still-relevant/","summary":"\u0026ldquo;Maybe Python or Go is a better choice?

Thanks for visiting my page!\nAbout me I’m originally from Brazil, but I live in Vancouver, BC.\nI love learning, including how to learn more effectively. I like to see how much I can change, and how much I can become a better version of myself.\nOnce I get interested in something, I’m pretty good at extracting what’s useful for me and changing my habits until I get a positive feedback loop. A few things I\u0026rsquo;m proud to have learned by myself:\n I learned English when I was a teenager by listening to songs and watching movies. My family didn\u0026rsquo;t have lots of money to invest in my Education. Also, I lived in such a tiny city that school languages didn\u0026rsquo;t even exist there. I adopted a whole foods plant-based diet. I\u0026rsquo;m super healthy effortlessly. I help the planet and reducing animal cruelty as a bonus. I used to invest +50% of my income following the FIRE - Financial Independence Retire Early - principles. I wrote a guide sharing my experience in a guide called Spark your Runway with FIRE. I completely rewired my brain to have a growth mindset and be more positive. I even read self-help books now.

Decide. What kills overconfidence is overthinking. Keep deciding, as if your life depends on it. If it helps, write down the consequences of your decision, and think through it with a rational perspective. What do you have to lose? Is probably less than you think. Fail fast. Learn. Keep trying. This process builds thicker skin. You’ll get more confident by trying, not from getting perfect on the first try. Perfection is the killer of great things. Take risks. Afraid of failing? So what! Do it either way. Confidence-boost is a habit. Risk keeps you on life’s edge. It keeps you growing, inspiring, and gaining confidence. Turn your fear into an ally. Fear is a powerful feeling. Instead of letting it stop you, can you imagine using that force to get you moving towards what you want? Break your big goals into small actionable goals. When facing big challenges, battle feelings of being overwhelmed by breaking them down. Something as simple as writing down a to-do list works. Practice self-compassion. When things don’t go as you expected, it’s the perfect moment to practice self-compassion. The central precept of self-compassion is that we should all be kinder to ourselves because doing so makes us healthier, more fulfilled, and more successful in the pursuits we choose. Name your inner negative voices. I started naming my negative voices: Judge Judy, Pam Planner. This helps me handle my cognitive distortions better. Once I identify who my voices are, I can say “thanks, Pam, but we’ll be fine!”. By the way, if your name is Judy or Pam, feel free to use my name for your voices :P. Start a Thought Record Journal. When you get yourself too overwhelmed by your cognitive distortions, add them to a Thought Record. Why does it work? It shows you that your thoughts are way less powerful than you think at first. Making them ‘real’ gives you an analytical perspective of the situation, and you realize it’s not that a big deal. Try it next time. Here’s a template to help you get started.  Somedays I have to practice them TWICE. But it gets easier every time 🏋️‍♀️.\nWhy does my brain try to sabotage me? 🧠 Nerdy as I am, I needed to understand why my brain was my biggest enemy.\nWell, it turns out it’s because our brain hasn’t evolved as we imagine.\nIt still thinks we live in the wild, and it’s trying to save us from predators. So I learned that my brain was just excessively trying to protect me. There’s danger in doing different things.\nSince our predators have changed, this protection is not well suited for our modern society anymore. If not recognized, our fear of getting out of our comfort zone can stop us from achieving great things.\nNow that you’ve got this information, every time you get yourself doubting yourself, take it as an opportunity to be grateful for recognizing this moment and say:\n Thanks, my primitive brain, for your concern, but I got this 💪\n Resources The Confidence Code: The Science and Art of Self-Assurance - What women should know*\nRadical Acceptance: Awakening the Love That Heals Fear and Shame\nFeeling Good: The New Mood Therapy\nCognitive Behavioral Therapy\nHow to practice Mindfulness\n*I strongly recommend it to anyone interested in understanding why women suffer more from lack of confidence, and how everyone can help solving this issue.\nIf you found this post helpful, follow me on Twitter and send me your thoughts :)\n","permalink":"https://www.stefannibrasil.me/posts/how-to-practice-self-confidence/","summary":"I believed I had to had born confident.
