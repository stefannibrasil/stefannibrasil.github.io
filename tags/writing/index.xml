      <description>One day, Roselyn got home and knew even before she opened the door that the cats were hungry. She had been late that day, and the cats have no problem in letting her know how impatiently they have been waiting for her. After feeding the cats and heating some leftovers to feed herself, she noticed there were two other cats in her home.
Two shadows that looked exactly like cats, to be more precise.</description>
