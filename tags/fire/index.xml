      <description>The first time I realized I was being too future-focused was when I got in a bad mental health state in 2020.
I didnâ€™t want to pay for Cognitive-Behavior Therapy sessions. I could have, but I didnâ€™t want to spend money on it. Not super clever, I know.
Looking back, I get mad at myself for putting savings before my mental health needs. This experience changed me, since it took me less than one year to improve my mental health, live a happier and confident life.</description>
