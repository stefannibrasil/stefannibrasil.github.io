      <description>Now that almost all Rails Conf 2021 talks are available on YouTube, you might be wondering which ones you should watch first.
By the way, the links will be added here as they are uploaded to RubyCentral&amp;rsquo;s Youtube channel :)
If you are just getting started with your Rails journey, here&amp;rsquo;s a list of 5 talks for you (with resources):

      <description>In the last Open Source Thursdays live, Thiago and I shared how we chose a few issues that looked promising for us.
By the end of the post, you&amp;rsquo;ll learn how to filter issues, and how to start contributing to Rails by reproducing a bug.
How to choose your first Ruby on Rails issue Which one from the +300 open issues should you pick? We tried breaking this process down into 2 parts: filtering them by labels, then choosing one that seems easier to fix.</description>

      <description>What is Open Source Thursdays? Open Source Thursdays is a new project from the hexdevs team, aka me and Thiago.
We started this project because we&amp;rsquo;ve always wanted to contribute to rails! So we thought, why not do it live so more people can join us? Our goal is to make open source contributions more popular.
Neither of us has done this before. The plan is to get there and do everything live, no preparing in advance.</description>

      <description>Ruby is keeping you interested in transitioning to the software development world. But you&amp;rsquo;re not sure you&amp;rsquo;re gonna be employable. You might have heard that you should just choose JavaScript because, you know, everyone is saying Ruby is a dying domain.
But you don&amp;rsquo;t see yourself keeping up with the Kardashians traditional JS web dev world.
You&amp;rsquo;ve heard that there are plenty of Ruby/Rails jobs out there. But how do you get your first one as an early career dev?</description>

      <title>Should you create a new Rails app as API-only?</title>

      <description>Before you get too excited and run rails new thecoolest --api on your terminal, it might be a good idea to take some time to consider what your needs are.
How different is a Rails API-only from a full-stack Rails app? As you can see in the image below, the API-only is a lighter version of a full stack Rails app:
The reason why it&amp;rsquo;s lighter is because Rails API-only won&amp;rsquo;t render HTML pages, handle user sessions &amp;amp; cookies, nor display any assets.</description>

      <description>Which authentication strategy should you use for Rails API? How to implement a secure authentication strategy is by the far the most confusing part of building an API.
It&amp;rsquo;s important to evaluate your app requirements before choosing any strategy in the first place to avoid any security implications.
To help you figure out which authentication strategy is the best for your case, here are 5 possible solutions for you:

      <description>&amp;ldquo;Maybe Python or Go is a better choice? Or even Javascript?&amp;rdquo; If you&amp;rsquo;ve been asking yourself these questions, this post is for you.
When I was learning how to code in 2016, Ruby on Rails was trending and every startup was using it. It was obvious that learning Rails would be an easy way to get my first dev job. We&amp;rsquo;re in 2021, though, and things have changed.
The answer to &amp;ldquo;Is Rails still relevant?</description>
