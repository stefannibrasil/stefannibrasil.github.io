      <description>Last year when visiting my local library (something that I love to do), an intriguing book cover caught my attention. It had a bright yellow cover with an interesting title: How to Be Perfect: The Correct Moral Answer to Every Question, from Michael Schur.
I checked it out without any questioning. It explains the process Michael went through to produce one of my favorite TV shows: &amp;ldquo;The Good Place&amp;rdquo;. If you have ever watched shows produced by Michael Schur, you might antecipate that the book is funny.</description>

      <description>The wind, with no excuses and surprises, takes over all the leaves from the trees.
One day, I was walking somewhere and witnessed the wind taking the remaining leaves of a tree. All I could think of was:
&amp;ldquo;wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be great if I could let things go just like that? A strong wind meets my past, removes all that doesn&amp;rsquo;t serve me anymore. For some time, I don&amp;rsquo;t carry anything, just nurture the roots of my core self to give space for a new season&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>Writing is easy. Anyone can write a post of 500 words.
But what does it take to go from a writer to becoming a writer with readers? Insights gathered by trying different things, willingness to make mistakes, and working in public.
Therefore, I always get curious when I find people who have successfully created writing careers, or businesses on top of their writing skills. This curiosity led me to read &amp;ldquo;The Art and Business of Online Writing&amp;rdquo;, by Nicolas Cole (my co-founder, Thiago Araujo, also recommended reading it).</description>
