      <description>In the last Open Source Thursdays live, Thiago and I shared how we chose a few issues that looked promising for us.
By the end of the post, you&amp;rsquo;ll learn how to filter issues, and how to start contributing to Rails by reproducing a bug.
How to choose your first Ruby on Rails issue Which one from the +300 open issues should you pick? We tried breaking this process down into 2 parts: filtering them by labels, then choosing one that seems easier to fix.</description>

      <description>What is Open Source Thursdays? Open Source Thursdays is a new project from the hexdevs team, aka me and Thiago.
We started this project because we&amp;rsquo;ve always wanted to contribute to rails! So we thought, why not do it live so more people can join us? Our goal is to make open source contributions more popular.
Neither of us has done this before. The plan is to get there and do everything live, no preparing in advance.</description>

      <description>Step 1: Decide to find one open-source project to contribute 😎
Step 2: Keep looking 👀
Step 3: They are all intimidating, is that normal? 😑
Step 4: What if I contributed to a project I have lots of experience with, like rails? I&amp;rsquo;d love to understand more about this tool I use every day 🤔
Step 5: OMG, the code is huge and scary, Will this even run on my machine?</description>
