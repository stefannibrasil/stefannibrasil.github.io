      <description>What differentiates perfectionism from excellence? I only learned the difference recently.
Reading this quote from the book &amp;ldquo;Work Clean: The life-changing power of mise-en-place to organize your life, work, and mind&amp;rdquo;, changed how I approached my work.
I used to feel proud by saying I was a perfectionist. That meant months, years of planning every single detail of everything. Setting the stakes higher as time went by.
Perfectionism is a great excuse for trying to control the results.</description>
