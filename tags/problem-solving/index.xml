      <description>We cannot solve our problems with the same thinking we used when we created them. Albert Einstein
 When you get stuck, it&amp;rsquo;s really easy to block yourself from creatively solving your problem.

You see, transitioning into tech is going to take more than just improving your coding skills.</description>

      <description>You&amp;rsquo;re working on your coding project. Everything is going well.
But it doesn&amp;rsquo;t take too long until you get stuck on your assignment. You try everything you possibly can, with the resources you have.
You are mixing Ruby, JavaScript, Postgres. Doing crash courses, googling. You go to the docs but you don&amp;rsquo;t even know where to look. It&amp;rsquo;s almost as if it&amp;rsquo;s a foreign language.
On StackOverflow, you see the same tips over and over.</description>
