      <description>When you get stuck, it‚Äôs really easy to block yourself from creatively solving your problem.
You start asking &amp;ldquo;why am I so dumb?&amp;rdquo;, or thinking that you don‚Äôt have a programmer&amp;rsquo;s brain, or feeling that you‚Äôll never understand anything.
How is that helpful? It isn‚Äôt.
The way we talk to each other (even to ourselves) impacts our performance. It‚Äôs not self-help BS. It‚Äôs how our brain works.</description>

      <description>You&amp;rsquo;re working on your coding project. Everything is going well.
But it doesn&amp;rsquo;t take too long until you get stuck on your assignment. You try everything you possibly can, with the resources you have.
You are mixing Ruby, JavaScript, Postgres. Doing crash courses, googling. You go to the docs but you don&amp;rsquo;t even know where to look. It&amp;rsquo;s almost as if it&amp;rsquo;s a foreign language.
On StackOverflow, you see the same tips over and over.</description>
